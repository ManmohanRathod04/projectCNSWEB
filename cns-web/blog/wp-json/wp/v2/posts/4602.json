on August 17. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">a botnet is a network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners&#8217; knowledge. <\/span><\/span><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">the &#8216;wirex&#8217; botnet comprises primarily Android devices running malicious applications and is designed to create a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack &#8212; that occurs when multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted system, usually one or more web servers. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">the botnet is often associated with ransom notes to targets. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">google\u00a0was alerted about the presence of this malware on play store, researchers from Akamai, CloudFlare, flashpoint, Oracle dyn, risk, and other organizations who cooperated to combat this botnet, researchers wrote in the post. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">shortly following the notification, Google removed hundreds of affected applications and started the process to remove the applications from all devices. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">&#8220;we identified approximately 700000 apps associated with the issue, blocked them from the play store, and we&#8217;re in the process of removing them from all affected devices,&#8221; Google said in a statement. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">&#8220;The researchers&#8217; findings, combined with our own analysis, have enabled us to better protect Android users, everywhere,&#8221; the statement added. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The first available indicators of the wirex botnet appeared on August 2 as minor attacks that went unnoticed at that time. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">These initial attacks were minimal and suggested that the malware was in development or in the early stages of deployment. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Prolonged attacks were identified starting from August 15, with some events sourced from a minimum of 70,000 concurrent ip addresses. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Analysis of the incoming attack data for the August 17 attack revealed that devices from more than 100 countries participated, an uncharacteristic trait for current botnets. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The investigation later revealed a connection between the attacking IPs and something malicious, running on top of the Android operating system. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">According to\u00a0Jared mauch, senior network architect and security researcher, akamai, the only way to be safe is by truly understanding what is happening on the internet. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">&#8220;trusted information sharing groups are one of the best ways to foster that understanding. In the case of the wirex botnet, a direct result of our information sharing and other research collaboration was our ability to fully uncover what made this malicious software tick in a much more timely manner,&#8221; Mauch said. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">&#8220;Working together to fight these threats benefits not only our collective customers but also internet users as a whole,&#8221; mauch added. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">last week, Akamai published a report in which\u00a0India\u00a0ranked eighth among countries most frequently targeted for web application attacks and stood fifth on the list of source countries, with close to 12 million attacks sourced from the country. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">the report said that there has been a 28 per cent year-over-year (YoY) increase in total DDoS attacks globally in the second quarter of 2017. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">though the frequency of DDoS attacks increased, the number of ip addresses involved in volumetric DDoS attacks dropped 98 per cent from 595,000 to 11,000 indicating the use of fewer devices to launch such attacks. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">ref:<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.gadgetsnow.com\/tech-news\/google-has-removed-700000-android-apps-from-playstore-and-taken-down-100000-developers-read-why\/articleshow\/62720159.cms\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">https:\/\/www.gadgetsnow.com\/tech-news\/google-has-removed-700000-android-apps-from-playstore-and-taken-down-100000-developers-read-why\/articleshow\/62720159.cms<\/span><\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>search giant Google recently threw out as many as android apps from its play store.
