We all are constantly connected with\nfriends, family, relatives, colleagues, peers, and the entire world for various\npurposes with social media. We all can even gather the knowledge in the form of\nvideo, blogs, podcast along with engaging with people through games,\ndiscussion, and experiences as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0This interaction is not just limited for chatting for sharing useful information but also has become one of the prominent tools for personal as well as professional growth in terms of learning. Therefore, many organizations are now opting for <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/learning-management-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Learning Management System (opens in a new tab)\">Learning Management System<\/a><\/strong> (LMS) which can integrate social media to make eLearning more engaging, interactive, and interesting at the same time for their employees.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Learning management system along with social media integration not only helps to support online training goals but also helps to increase the participation and engagement of the users. The major effectiveness to include social media in your learning or training programs will surely depend upon the fact that how positively your business supports the use of social media in your entire work culture.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that as there are more and more people logging into Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn on daily basis and are connected on social media platforms for latest updates and what\u2019s happening in the world, but it becomes imperative to customize your LMS and align your training session with social media and analytics. Your LMS can be highly measurable by adding social meaning features and analytics to your training and learning programs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this guide, we have listed the 5 major reasons to explain how social media integration of LMS can provide an engaging and interactive eLearning as below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Content outreach<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As your LMS users are highly connected online, hence they can share the information in the real-time world by various social media channels<strong>.<\/strong> They can share what they have learned using your LMS and what best practices you have to create an impactful <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"eLearning mobile app (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/e-learning-mobile-app-developer\" target=\"_blank\">eLearning mobile app<\/a><\/strong> platform. All this is not because you need to boost the outreach of your content but also it helps to increase online visibility. Social media integration also provides you an opportunity for connecting with your target audience swiftly and thus builds credibility among them in the most natural way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>User-generated content<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We all love to share our experiences, achievements, and success on social media so that the world would come to know about us. The learners can also share their experience with their peers, who all would be benefitted from your training. This will provide them an opportunity to use your leaner\u2019s feedback as original content and reach out to potential target audience by posting it on various platform or industry forums with<strong> <\/strong>lms<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"mobile application development (opens in a new tab)\">mobile application development<\/a>. <\/strong>In addition to all this, it is the user-generated content that can help you to organically promote your business, eLearning course, etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Measurable analytics<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the increase in demand for internet and mobile devices, the learning has gone beyond time, demographics, and physical appearance. When your LMS has social media integration, then it can offer 24*7 accessibility to all the leaners and can encourage them to help themselves in achieving their daily goals. Along with this, if the learning program is using <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"LRS (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Learning_Record_Store#:~:text=A%20Learning%20Record%20Store%20(LRS,Caliper%20standard%20by%20IMS%20Global.\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>LRS<\/strong><\/a>, then you can store data about your learner experience thus analyzing their social media habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Interactive learning<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media when connected with the Learning management system, allows the admin to create interest-based polls, surveys, and discussion thus to engage learners as well as the trainers. We all know that people are constantly connected with their mobile or laptop, therefore they tend to interact more by sharing their common interests. It not only helps to spread the main aim of the eLearning program but also enables to close communication among all the leaners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Compound learning<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With social media integration along with LMS, the\nlearners can get to learn things in multiple styles such as by video, audio,\ninfographics, and distribute the same by using social media. By doing so, the\nlearning methods will become more interactive and shareable hence every one or\nthe other person enjoys learning things quickly. This way you can also opt for\nthird party integration which can act as a medium to deliver your training with\nthe help of LMS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are still wondering whether you should incorporate social media learning in your eLearning system or not, then you must think about it once again and perform these actions. The customized learning management system will enable social media connection, user analytics, payment integration for all learning, and business solution needs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all know that social media has become one of the most crucial parts of our day to day lives.
