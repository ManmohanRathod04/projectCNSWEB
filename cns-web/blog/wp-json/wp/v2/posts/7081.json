It will revive the important bend milestone as it moves- broadens, inclinations, and turns, in the particular sense- to the beats of Spotify playlists to be explicit &#8220;Diwali Shuffle&#8221;, &#8220;Diwali Drive&#8221;, or &#8220;Diwali Bash&#8221;. It acts primarily just like any other Snapchat Lens. Open Snapchat when you are close to the Gateway of India, tap on the bolstered Spotify point of convergence in the location of convergence carousel, and after that point your camera at the milestone. It will be available for the coming next ten days until October 23 at the Gateway of India in Mumbai.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Highlights<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Diwali-themed, Spotify-driven Snapchat\nlens is a part of Snapchat&#8217;s \u201cLandmarker\u201d experience which was incipiently\nlaunched in April this year with five locations. The locations are namely-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The Eiffel Tower in the Paris<\/li><li>The Buckingham Palace in London<\/li><li>The US Capitol, Washington, D.C.<\/li><li>The Flatiron Building in New York, and<\/li><li>The TCL Chinese Theater, Los Angeles.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, it then extended to India in\nAugust with Agra&#8217;s Taj Mahal and the Gateway. By growing its India centric\nfeatures, Snap Inc. wishes to see more Indian users on board. Snapchat has\ncollaborated up with different brands for themed activations previously as\nwell. The collaboration included HBO for Game of Thrones&#8217; final season, and\nSony Pictures for Spider-Man: Far from Home, the Marvel movie.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those thinking about how Snapchat\nassembled these &#8220;Landmarker&#8221; Augmented Reality focal points, their\narchitects didn&#8217;t visit the landmarks to make a 3D model. Preferably, said 3D\nmodels are produced using client submitted photographs and recordings to\nSnapchat&#8217;s &#8220;Our Story&#8221; area, which are accumulations of a spot,\noccasion, or subject in addition to other things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We needed to outfit Spotify&#8217;s clients with an encounter that they would need to impart to companions in a split second. Along these lines the possibility of the Gateway of India in Mumbai moving to the beats of the Spotify&#8217;s Diwali playlist was conceived,&#8221; Snapchat&#8217;s head of business system and promotion monetization for India, Tarika Soni, said in a readied proclamation. &#8220;This is the first-historically speaking brand coordinated effort for Snapchat&#8217;s as of late propelled &#8216;Landmarker&#8217; Lens in Asia. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snapchat clients in Mumbai will be energized and amazed by this actuation when they go to the Gateway of India to see it.
