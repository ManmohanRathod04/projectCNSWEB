Senior authorities from TRAI affirmed that no individual data of clients will be gathered and information got by the controller will be mysterious. The information gathered from individual applications can likewise be seen on the site named <span style=\"color: #333333\"><strong><a style=\"color: #333333\" href=\"http:\/\/analytics.trai.gov.in\/\">analytical.trai.gov.in<\/a><\/strong><\/span>.
