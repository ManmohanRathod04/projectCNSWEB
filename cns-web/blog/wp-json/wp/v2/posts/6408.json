Being the latest version of an integrated development environment, it aids in the workflows of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Android app developers (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/android-apps-developer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Android app developers<\/strong><\/a> in building an app and managing its resources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new version is backed up with many improvements at the performance level with bug fixes as a part of the Project Marble by the Android Studio Team. Though the release has a small set of new features these address the core issues faced by the developers in building applications and managing the resources as exclaimed by the product manager Jamal Eason.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new R8 replaces the default obfuscator-Proguard which shrunk the code with a better project structure dialog along with a new resource management tool for the applications and the Android Emulator which is backed up by the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Android Q Beta (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/android-q-beta-installation-process\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Android Q Beta<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Let us look at the newly incorporated features in central areas of mobile\napp workflow:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h3>Develop:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Resource Manager<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier, it was challenging to manage navigation and asset on the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Android Studio (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Android_Studio\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Android Studio<\/strong><\/a>. It was hard and clumpy to operate when the complexity of the app increased. The new resource manager can visualize the layouts, colors, and drawables all together in the app. The new panel is capable of supporting the bulk asset with drag and drop options. The new attribute added to the tool will augment the usability of the application and provide an exceptional asset management experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Import Intentions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While working with the latest libraries like Jetpack\nand Firebase, the new updated version is intelligent enough to recognize the\nstandard classes in the libraries. It will suggest necessary library based\nimport and dependence statements with its import intentions and save the user\u2019s\ntime and assist them to stay updated with the code.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Refreshed layout properties panel<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The new panel will help to refine and polish the\nproduct with a single pane that has collapsible sections for properties in\nwhich the errors and the warnings come in highlighted colors with a resource\nbinding control for all the properties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Build:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>PSD<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the improvements in the project structure dialog,\nthe users will be able to enjoy a new user interface front end that will allow\nthe developers to arrange and manage the project at the module level and handle\nGradle project files. New variations can be built using the new PSD to improve\nthe configurations of the files.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>R8<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years back, R8 was seen as a replacement of the\nProguard. R8 helps to eliminate the unused code and reducing the size of an APK\nby combining three steps of design, desugaring, and shrinking in one step.\nFurther, the actual code even does not take much space. So, it is a default\ncode shrinker that can be built using Android studio 3.4 and Android Cradle\nplugin. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Test<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Android 3.4, the developers have also\nlaunched the device skins for Google Pixel 3XL and Google Pixel 3. So, it will\nbe convenient for the users while app testing to download the images from\nAndroid Q Beta emulator system. Also, the users can make use of the Android\nStudio Canary along with the emulator on running the Android Q Beta program to\nreceive the latest changes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version of Android studio 3.4 with its new features and properties to fix the bugs in the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Android app development (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/android-application-development\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Android app development<\/strong><\/a> will deliver a new experience to the end users.
