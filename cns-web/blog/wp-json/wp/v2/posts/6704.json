The very first thing you will encounter will be to plan out your approach for development. It needs a lot of discussions, often a heated debate that you should follow Waterfall or Agile.

However, there are significant differences highlighted above that define which is best for application development. Most of the digital projects and entrepreneurs opt <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"agile methodology (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Agile_software_development\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>agile methodology<\/strong><\/a>; on the other hand, if you are scaling up and have stable project requirements &amp; management, you may consider the waterfall approach. Regardless of the approach you take, it is imperative to be flexible and ready to adapt on the go as neither methodology guarantees project success.
