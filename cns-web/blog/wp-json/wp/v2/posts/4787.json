Including everything from music, navigation, organization, messaging, photo editing, reading, social networks, keyboards, stargazing, and payment apps, these pieces of software will turn an iOS device into a pro-level computing machine.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As per my my research, I have come with some Best iPhone apps identified as \u201cthe best\u201d on reviewers, writers, clients, and also employees. These Apps are developed by <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/list-top-10-trusted-iphone-app-development-companies-world\/\">top iPhone application development companies<\/a><\/strong> which are ranked in top in terms of cost, project timeline, quality and regular communication.<!--more--><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h4>Chrome<\/h4>\n<p>Every iPhone ships with Apple&#8217;s suite of apps. However, if you happen to love Apple&#8217;s hardware but not so much its software, the first switch you should make is your browser. Google&#8217;s Chrome is the most popular browser of them all and for a good reason. Chrome comes with a great incognito mode and other features that make web-surfing on your phone less of a pain. It&#8217;s also constantly updated and is just one of the most jam-packed browsers out there.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h4>Lyft<\/h4>\n<p>At some point you&#8217;re going to need a cab and there just won&#8217;t be any in sight. Save yourself some time now and go ahead and download Lyft. Operating in most major cities, Lyft will come pick you up whenever and wherever you need them, often for less cash than a traditional taxi. Watch out for surge pricing, though. If rides are in high demand then prices often double, and can reach more than ten times their regular rate. If Lyft isn&#8217;t in your area, or you just want to try another flavor of ride-sharing, there&#8217;s always uber but lyft treats drives better.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h4>Sky Guide<\/h4>\n<p>To understand your place in the universe and not just the world Sky Guide is an indispensable app. It shows you the locations of stars, planets, and constellations through an AR-like interface. Simply point the phone in any direction, and your display will show you the names of the stars and planets that you can see. If you want to try a free version, you can also check out for free.<\/li>\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<h4>Instapaper or Pocket<\/h4>\n<p>Reading on the internet can be an overwhelming experience with social networks, messaging, email, and personal assistants all serving up possible reads. Instapaper and Pocket help tame that information deluge. Pocket tends to be best with multimedia while Instapaper guns for the perfect reading experience no matter what.<\/li>\n<li>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evernote<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evernote is essentially a virtual notebook you have with you everywhere perfect for downloading whatever is bouncing around in your brain. You can make notes directly in the app, save images and articles from the web, upload pages from physical notebooks, and track tasks. Evernote can even handle audio files. The best part? Everything you add to Evernote is searchable, so you can find it next week (or even five years from now) quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, there are much more iPhone Apps, says a senior coder at AppSquadz, a leading fast growing application development firm providing cutting-edge <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/ios-application-development-company\">iPhone application development<\/a><\/strong> in USA and India and for other major platforms such as Android, Blackberry, Windows, etc.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you just picked up a iphone or you&#8217;re looking for an app revamp, these iphone apps belong on your home screen.
