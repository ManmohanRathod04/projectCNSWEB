At a starting price of Rs 89,000 ($999), iPhone X is the company&#8217;s most expensive iPhone launched so far. Apple CEO Tim Cook called iPhone X &#8220;the biggest leap forward since the original iPhone.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here&#8217;s all features of iPhone X you need to know \u2026<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">OLED Screen<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apple iPhone X is the only one of the three new iPhones launched (other being iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus) to have an 5.8-inch OLED display. It features Apple\u2019s highest resolution phone display: 2436 x 1125 pixels at 458 pixels per inch density (ppi). The company has termed this Super Retina display. The HDR display also supports Dolby Vision and HDR10.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Water Resistance, Glass Back Panel<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apple iPhone X comes with an all-glass front and back. It features what Apple claims is &#8220;the most durable glass ever in a smartphone in silver or space gray, while a highly polished, surgical-grade stainless steel band seamlessly wraps around and reinforces iPhone X. A seven-layer color process allows for precise color hues and opacity on the glass finish, and a reflective optical layer enhances the rich colors, making the design as elegant as it is durable while maintaining water and dust resistance.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Drops Home Button<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Courtesy edge-to-edge display, there&#8217;s no Home button on iPhone X,<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/ios-application-development-company\">iPhone application development companies<\/a><\/strong> has removed home button. Users now just need to tap on the smartphone to &#8216;wake it up&#8217;. It has also got a new gesture language, swiping up will launch the multitasking screen. To switch to another app, users just need to pause mid-swipe. Holding the larger side button will launch Siri. This is what dedicated iPhones developers from USA &amp; India did.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">TouchID Makes Way for FaceID<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There&#8217;s no fingerprint sensor in iPhone X. The TouchID has been replaced by FaceID. iPhone X uses facial recognition to unlock. Users can set up FaceID by letting their iPhone X make a detailed digital &#8220;map&#8221; of their face. Apple claims that FaceID is much easier and safer. According to the company, there&#8217;s a one in a million chance of someone being able to &#8216;hack&#8217; your phone. FaceID is said to be powered by &#8216;neural engine&#8217; powered by the company&#8217;s A11 Bionic processor.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Features Wireless Charging<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wireless charging comes to iPhones with iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus. The wireless charging in the new iPhones uses a standard called Qi, the same that is also used by Samsung Electronics. Apple also announced that it is making a charging mat called AirPower that can simultaneously charge an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Storage Variants: 64GB and 256GB<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iPhone X comes in two storage variants, 64GB and 256GB. Apple iPhone X is priced at Rs 89,000 while 256GB variant is priced at Rs 1,02,000.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dual Camera Set-up<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iPhone X has dual camera setup at the back. Both the rear cameras are 12MP and have optical image stabilisation (OIS) support. While one has an aperture of f\/1.8, the other has f\/2.4. It offers 4K video recording, new quad LED True Tone Flash with Slow Sync. At the front, there&#8217;s a 7MP TrueDepth camera. Apple is said to have developed it specially for FaceID.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Powered by A11 Processor<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">iPhone X is powered by Apple&#8217;s all-new new A11 bionic chipset. It has a six-core CPU design. Apple claims that it offers two hours of higher battery life than iPhone 7.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Pre-orders start October 27 in 55 countries across the world, including India<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apple iPhone X&#8217;s pre-orders will start in 55 countries across the globe, including India, on October 27.
