Since the initial release, Flutter has flourished in a short time. Millions of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"mobile app developers (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/hire-mobile-app-developer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>mobile app developers<\/strong><\/a> are using Flutter for app development purposes. From the last one year, the Flutter app development framework has emerged as the fastest-growing language and open-source project. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time the latest release <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Flutter 1.12 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Flutter_(software)\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Flutter 1.12<\/strong><\/a> may not appear to be a significant release. Still, Google has proclaimed that the fifth stable release of the Flutter framework will bring in subtle improvements. These enhancements cover the beta version of web support and the alpha release of macOS support. Furthermore, it also combines <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"iOS 13 (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/ios-13-prominent-features-coming-iphone\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>iOS 13<\/strong><\/a> Dark Mode support, enhanced Add-to-App experience, and much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google also revealed the company itself employs Flutter often\nfor its mobile apps. The company is delighted with the results and is making\nits mind to incorporate more modern and advanced features in Flutter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By a plug-in that exports Adobe XD designs straight away into\nFlutter, Adobe announced support for Flutter in its Creative Cloud.\nAdditionally, the company also said, the XD to Flutter plug-in is going to be\navailable as open-source at the beginning of 2020 however as of now you have\nthe option to sign-up for early access on Adobe&#8217;s website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Flutter?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is Google\u2019s mobile app SDK, having frameworks, widgets, and tools, that furnishes mobile app developers with a simple way to develop and deploy visually attractive and robust mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms. Flutter facilitates a stable and secure cross-platform <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"mobile app development (opens in a new tab)\">mobile app development<\/a><\/strong> and most importantly, it cuts down substantial app development costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What makes Flutter the right choice among app developers and app owners<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>One code for two platforms<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The work of the application developers gets reduced as they\nhave to write one codebase for both the apps- Android and iOS platforms. Since\nFlutter has its widgets and designs, it doesn&#8217;t depend on the platform, which\nmeans you have the same app on both platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Less testing<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The same app is on both the platforms, which means you\nrequire testing once which in turn makes the quality assurance process faster.\nDevelopers have to check the app just once and write automatic tests only once\nas it has one codebase. Less testing will fasten the development process, which\nis a positive aspect for app owners and developers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>UI which your users will admire<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Dark-Mode-Flutter-1.jpg\" alt=\"Flutter Dark Mode\" class=\"wp-image-7428\" width=\"700\" height=\"650\"\/><figcaption> <br>Flutter Dark Mode <\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Flutter is designed in such a way that it focuses on native\nend-user experiences. The layered architecture enables complete customization,\nwhich results in incredibly quick rendering and robust and compliant designs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Faster apps<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Apps made on Flutter perform smoothly and in a quick way,\nwithout hanging while scrolling. From the technical point of view, the\ndevelopment process gets minimized as one codebase is used for both the\nplatforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we have brought into light some of the features and essential points that the Flutter 1.12 holds. Google has announced its latest release with Adobe XD Support. Also, we have talked about what makes Flutter app development the best choice among mobile app developers as well as the app owners. We have also discussed the pros of Flutter briefly.
