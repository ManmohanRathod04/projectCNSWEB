This task is performed by software, named crawler or a spider.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Indexing <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of building an index for all the retrieved web pages and storing them in an enormous database from where it can be recovered later.

Also, at this stage, you deal with website structure, SEO keywords, title optimizations, headings, internal links, image SEO, structured data markup, and other techniques that can transfer the right signals to search engines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Off-site SEO<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The third stage is Off-Page SEO.
