So, in case you are looking for a career in mobile application development in India, it is best to tap into the mobile application market. According to a recent survey, it has been found that an average cost to build an application for Android\/iOS is almost 10 times lower than to mobile app development companies in USA.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Survey also indicated that if any business is looking forward to minimize the cost of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/mobile-application-development-company-android-ios-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>mobile application development<\/strong><\/a> should consider India as their development partner. In the survey, it was found that an average Android or iOS application consumes eight weeks in development which costs about $48,000 (if charged $150 per hour in the USA). While in India the same application costs about $4800 with rate of being $15 per hour. This further implies that, if an Indian mobile app developer spent 8 hours per day on an average, the project would take 8 weeks to get completed.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The inflating application ecosystem, rising market of the mobile app industry, talented and skilled application developers and inexpensive development costs are some of the factors that make India a perfect outsourcing mobile app development country.
