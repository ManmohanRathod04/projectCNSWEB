It is become unbelievably capricious. Take an example of Adobe only, the company Adobe is known to be working on software which is on the same platform as Photoshop but it\u2019s going to be especially for audio. No, it\u2019s not called Audioshop! The code name given to this new software is Project VoCo. The USP of this software is that if offers you the ability to add words which are actually not present in an audio file.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Although it\u2019s not clear whether this product will be made available commercially or not, it was confirmed by the Adobe about the existence of the project to The Verge. It was clarified that it was shown off as part of a sneak peak program at the MAX conference. The project is in its developmental stage and it\u2019s as part of collaboration between members of Princeton University and Adobe Research.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The Project VoCo is being considered as a premium Audio Editing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/mobile-application-development-company.html\">Application<\/a> which not only supports standard speech editing and noise cancellation features but also will have the function to generate new words using recorded voice of a person. It means that the software will be able to understand the makeup of a person\u2019s voice and will try to imitate it. However it require about twenty minutes of speech recording.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">As per an official statement by Adobe, it was stated that most of the time when recording dialog, narration or voiceovers, people usually make some changes or add a couple of words either due to a mistake or may be because they might want to make changes in some part of the narration or dialog. This newly developing technology named Project VoCo will let one simply type in the words or lines that he\/she would like to insert or change into the narration or voiceover. The algorithm of the software does the rest of the things and makes it sound like the part of original voiceover, narration or dialog.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">If <a href=\"http:\/\/www.adobe.com\/#\">Adobe<\/a> is able to develop this under-progress project successfully, it is surely going to be one of the most significant and much loved software in the future.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Slowly and steadily, technology is advancing day by day.
