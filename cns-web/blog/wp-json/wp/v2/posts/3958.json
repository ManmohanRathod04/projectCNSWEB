As a matter of fact, no matter if a website is mobile-friendly, it cannot serve a large customer base. This means that you need to expand your business from mobile-friendly website to a mobile app.<!--more--><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Native App or Hybrid App?<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to some analysis, it has been found that mobile applications are more expedient and serve the users in a better way than a mobile-compatible website or a desktop website. A mobile application smooth the progress of one-touch access to the website in a quicker and smarter way. A <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\" target=\"_blank\">mobile app<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0can represent the same GUI like the mobile-compatible website. However, you need to choose prudently whether you would want to opt for a mobile application or a mobile-friendly website.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Native Applications<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Native mobile applications need writing codes in a particular programming language, example Object Oriented C for iOS devices, like iPhone &amp; iPad and Java for Android devices. These applications are extremely efficient, reliable and provide high performance when run on friendly devices. Different online shopping applications offer the retailers more customers comparatively, which is mainly a reason to select a native application for business.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hybrid Applications<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These applications offer you the UI (User Interface) of the mobile-compatible website inside a native container which make use of the mobile\u2019s hardware to work. Such websites are functional across diverse platforms integrating the technologies such as HTML5, JavaScript, &amp; CSS. However, they possess a device- specific nature and the website content located on diverse sections can differ as per the screen resolution. two of the most common platforms to develop hybrid applications are PhoneGap and Mosync.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, if you are also having just a mobile friendly website and want to expand your business from mobile-friendly website to a mobile app, then <strong>AppSquadz Technologies<\/strong> is the place where your search ends.
