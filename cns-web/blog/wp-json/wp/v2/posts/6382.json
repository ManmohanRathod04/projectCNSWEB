These native-like\nfeatures are ready to compile into native components. These components are just\nthe counterparts of the elements in iOS and Android. Thus, the reusability\nfeature allows hybrid applications to render natively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides\nthe classic hybrid frameworks, these components also allow building apps based\non the web-style and agility without the need of web with the speed, appearance\nand features like native applications. Therefore it reduces the number of\nresources the developer has to depend upon during development. With a small\nrange of skills, the developer can develop apps for iOS, Android and web.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Third part plug-in compatibility<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With\nthis framework, it is possible to add third-party features via their\nplug-ins.&nbsp; It helps by linking the\nplug-in with the native module so that the functionality can be added to the\ndevice with higher speed and less memory utilization to give a smooth user experience.\nWithout these features, it would be difficult to add the\ndevice\u2019s hardware features to the mobile app. Its library has several\nthird-party plug-ins that help developers to add devices like features like\nBluetooth, GPS in the mobile application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>No refurbished code <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/react-native-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"React Native App Development company (opens in a new tab)\">React Native App Development company<\/a><\/strong> makes use of the available library to append native elements to the current mobile application.
