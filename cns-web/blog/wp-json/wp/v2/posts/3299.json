Even after the deployment of patches directly by Google every month, the sluggishness of intermediaries such as OEMs and carriers has put the entire platform in a position of ambiguity, particularly when compare with the more vertically integrated iOS platform.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In a security conference which was held in Manhattan yesterday, the lead engineer for Android security at Google, Adrian Ludwig stated advancement of Google in protecting its mobile platform, and placing it in direct competition with its opponent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">One of the questions that was raised was about direct face-off of Google\u2019s new Pixel with the <span style=\"color: #333333\"><a style=\"color: #333333\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/iPhone-Development.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>iPhone<\/strong><\/a><\/span>, and when questioned whether the both are equivalent when it is about security, Adrian Ludwig answered \u201cfor sure\u201d. And in fact, he also stated that Android will soon \u201cbe better\u201d, according to the report.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">According to Adrian Ludwig, \u201cIn the long term, the open ecosystem of <strong><span style=\"color: #333333\"><a style=\"color: #333333\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/android-application-development.html\" target=\"_blank\">Android<\/a><\/span><\/strong> is going to put it in a much better place,\u201d nothing was revealed about the statement. He did mentioned about Android\u2019s built-in security product named \u201cSafety Net\u201d, although, saying that the service scans around 400 million devices and more than 6 billion applications every single day.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The results of these tests matched with the safety measures already provided into the OS ensure that a very small amount of devices is left out and hence possibly subject of malware \u2014 or, as per Google\u2019s words, PHAs, (Potentially Harmful Applications). As per a graph shown by Adrian Ludwig at the conference, less than 1% of Android devices resulted affected.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">To discussed the point further, he stated about previous year&#8217;s much-talked &#8216;Stagefright security breach&#8217; into the discussion, claiming that even after the detection of numerous critical bugs, a real-life hack is yet to be noticed on an Android device. With mentioning that, he also said that this doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t nothing much left to do.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Well there is still time to see whether the plans of Google will be fruitful as per its expectation or not. It will be beneficial for both users and the company if the security issue is enhanced.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Source: <span style=\"color: #333333\"><a style=\"color: #333333\" href=\"https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2016\/11\/02\/android-as-secure-as-ios-on-iphone-says-google-director-of-security\/\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/9to5google.com\/2016\/11\/02\/android-as-secure-as-ios-on-iphone-says-google-director-of-security\/<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since very long, Android was being criticised for lack of security.
