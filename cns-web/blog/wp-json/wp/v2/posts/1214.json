This person may exist in your company, and if not, then hire someone.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Enlist, Empower and Encourage (Rule of 3E):<\/strong>Every employee at your company would like to get encouragement from your side. The rule of 3E is a general and crucial rule that improves your culture. You should optimize your hiring process to enlist the best employees for your company. It\u2019s not all about percentage that the candidate acquired in graduation or wanted degree, it\u2019s all about the candidate\u2019s interest in your company, the learning capacity, the power to handle pressures, the ability to express and present new ideas. The people person or the lead person of your company should motivate the employees in various manners as by giving rewards, giving incentives, or by starting competitions sometimes. &nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Respect and Care\nfor all: <\/strong>Every single\nemployee (senior or junior or CEO) will expect respect and care from your\ncompany more than the expected offered package. You should create an\nenvironment where everyone has the feeling to contribute into your company, not\ngetting salary (maybe it\u2019s the main reason, but the eternal feeling should\ncontribute your company). The work should be done in a team, not individually.\nThis will lead enhancements in the working proficiency of employees. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Stress-free Environment:\n<\/strong>As you would like to get 100% of employees,\nso you have to give your 100%.

You should consult with your lead member about\nthe results. If anything is getting wrong, make it close at time. Along with\nstress-free and cheerful culture, your employees should remember their\npunctuality. The project should get closed at said date and time. Never ever\nforget your purpose.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Be the example:<\/strong>With the employees, you too have to improve your personality. The employees learn from their boss, and thus, the results are at your own in somehow manner. You will punctual, your employees will be punctual. You have to develop your personality so that they can learn from you. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Maintain and carefully\nevolve your culture: <\/strong>When all is setup,\nthe maintenance is the main issue.
