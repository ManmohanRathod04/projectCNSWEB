From the hardware startups close connection to a well-built fanbase, OnePlus\u00a0 3T is surely a great bet. As other new brands such as Le Eco on the Smartphone scene brags to be the flashiest and biggest, the company has been bringing remarkable handsets from the inception.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But OnePlus 3T is a bit of mystery. The new device is surely keeping with OnePlus\u2019s focus on the quality, however for those who went all in with the brand&#8217;s last flagship a few months back, the phone may feel like a little disappointing, increasing the specifications and replacing the phone half-a-year after its launch. The OnePlus 3 is undoubtedly an exceptional phone and a strong nominee for 2016\u2019s best Smartphone. But, apparently the title now clearly belongs to another.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The OnePlus 3 is surely a great looking Smartphone \u2013 and so is the new 3T as well. Both models look pretty much the same. The company\u2019s has managed to keep the size and weight of its predecessor (6.01 x 2.94 x 0.29 inches, and 5.57 ounces). Let us know a more about this newly launched OnePlus 3t in detail.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The display of the phone is the same as before, a 5.5-inch 1920 x 1080. With 401 PPI \u2013 same as what is offered on the iPhone 7 Plus. While this is not the sharpest display out in the market, but it\u2019s definitely clear and bright, and it is perfect for its price point.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rear-facing camera of this model is same 16-megapixel, but the phone does a bit more processing to enhance low light shots. So you can grab some good clicks in pretty dark conditions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, while the rear-facing camera has the same specifications, OnePlus has given this model a selfie upgrade. The OnePlus 3t grab clear front-facing shots easily.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The upgrade of this model starts to shine with the integration of a Snapdragon 821. This is a definitely a big win for a budget device, placing it in alongside the likes of the Zenfone 3 and Google Pixel0. This lone addition is likely a big asset what made the company to release a new handset outside of a yearly upgrade schedule.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The RAM in this device is the same 6GB but it is a perfect partner for the new processor to have an extremely smooth user experience. The 3000 mAh battery of the OnePlus 3 gets a 13% capacity more power making it to 3400 mAh \u2013 almost close to Pixel XL\u2019s 3,450 mAh. With this much battery power, a user can expect a couple of days of standard use.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dash Charging is back with 3T, so you can fuel an empty battery of 3T half way in just thirty minutes. As Google is cracking down on third-party solutions, this can be a bit downside for the OnePlus at the moment as the charging works only with the company&#8217;s proprietary charger.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coming to storage, the company is still offering 64GB, however now you can double the space by adding an extra $40 onto your billing of 3T. But remember, though there is a dual-SIM slot, you will not be able to add a microSD in for extra storage.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coming to the conclusion, many of the folks will be wondering whether the new handset is worth an upgrade over its predecessor. Well, it depends but with a heavy processor and nice battery life and added storage, surely 3T can be said a good upgrade over its predecessor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The device is priced at $439, which is $40 more than its previous version, but it seems appropriate considering all of the upgrades the company is offering here. Moreover, the price is well below the Google Pixel XL\u2019s which is whooping $769.<\/p>\n<p>Source :<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/23\/oneplus-3t-review\/\">https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/23\/oneplus-3t-review\/<\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>OnePlus 3T Smartphone OnePlus has always been among popular choices of people.
