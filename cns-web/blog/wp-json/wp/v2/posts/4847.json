From things to human beings, everyone is connected to the internet directly or indirectly.\u00a0Internet of things is the conceptualization and application of this aspect of interconnectivity among objects and people or within individuals to make otherwise time consuming tasks easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Internet of things aims at incorporating this idea of binding each daily necessity with technology to increase it\u2019s outreach to everyone\u2019s lives which will slowly and steadily lead to creating a huge societal impact with the help of mobile application development for such purposes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>What is Internet of Things?\u00a0<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The internet of things is the inter connectivity of various \u2018things or functions\u2019 over a network such that it leads to reduction in interaction between the device or <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/\">mobile application<\/a><\/strong> and the person operating it. It can be used to reduce human-human or human-machine interaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">The things mentioned in the above sentence, can be everyday devices like watches, glasses, light bulbs, a pacemaker placed in the human heart or even a basic food item. These things can be installed with sensors and can thus be controlled remotely or locally by a device or any mobile application.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Benefits:<br \/>\n<\/strong>1) Time saving: The collection of information directly from source and transferring of this digitally computed data over a network and quick display of items through a web or mobile application leads to almost 40% saving in time. Also, information collected and shared is much faster and this leads to an increase in outputs for users as well as businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">2) Accurate: The data collected by these sensors is accurate and highly precise as it does not get affected by human error. The basic experimental and parallax errors are avoided and a highly precise result is obtained.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">3) Economical: A onetime investment in such a technology can lead to various cuts elsewhere. For example the manual force required for management and administration is decreased.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">4) Increased data collection and processing: The quantity and quality of data collected is also increased in such an arrangement. The interconnectivity allows fast access and processing can be done at a much higher rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Risks:<br \/>\n<\/strong>1) Security: Since this technology is new and upcoming the security threats associated with this are high. The data and it\u2019s safety come up as areas of major concern here. Thus local and national data which may be stored and collected using IoT can have major consequences if not stored or encrypted properly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">2) Safety: Safety of data is another concern as there can be endless possibilities of the data being hacked or compromised.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Applications:<br \/>\n<\/strong>This technology has various applications in all major industries right now. A few examples are listed below:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Healthcare \u2013 In the healthcare industry, this technology is being used to monitor the medicine cycle of patients and give them a reminder as to when to purchase a new set. Also, a number of sensors are used to check the patient\u2019s vital signs etc inside and outside the hospital.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Food industry \u2013 In the food sector, these sensors are being used to make the customer aware about the freshness and helping them monitor the shelf life of a product. Also, these sensors also show whether a product has been contaminated or not and if it is fit for consumption.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Logistics: The RFID technology is being used in ID cards, libraries etc to track products and make their identification much easier.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Domestic security: Internet of things is being used in homes to imply safer residencies. Homes are now installed with cameras and alarms which can also be remotely controlled.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\"><strong>Appsquadz interventions:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">As a <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/mobile-application-development-company\">mobile application development company<\/a><\/strong>, AppSquadz understands the advent of internet of things and keeps in mind the needs of it\u2019s clients to form and execute an application which can perform as per the needs and demands of their innovative product.
