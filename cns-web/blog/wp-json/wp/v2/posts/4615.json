Various technologies like mobiles, Internet etc helps us to stay connected, well informed and upgraded. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">Let\u2019s talk about the most used technology in today\u2019s time, which is a mobile phone or a smart phone. Almost 70% of the world population uses mobile phones for the purpose of communication, information, business, etc. In order to make a mobile phone user-friendly, various changes and add-ons have been done by mobile application developers from India &amp; USA in today\u2019s time because of which they are now called smart phones.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> <span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">We all are aware of the mobile applications that have made our life easier. We were never so connected which we are and it hasn\u2019t been possible without these applications and mobile application developers. Whether we talk about WhatsApp, WeChat, Instagram, ShareIt etc. all these mobile applications have become a part of our daily routine. Not a day goes by when we don\u2019t check these applications because we have become so addicted and dependent that it is quite hard to stay away from them. <\/span><\/span><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">To give better facilities and with a user-friendly approach, top app developers keep on developing new mobile applications by adding various features to it, to attract its users.

Whenever an application is developed there are various steps that are taken care of in order to come out with the best results. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">The Steps are as follows:<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">1. Consulting: Mobile app developers first try to understand what kind of mobile application is required by their clients. They try to understand the objective and who are their target customers\/audience.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">2. Design: The second step is designing of application with a user-friendly approach. The Android &amp; iOS applications which are too complicated to use are often not liked by the users and doesn\u2019t work well.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">3. Testing: Ones the application is designed, it has to be tested.Testing helps the dedicated developer to know about the changes that are required to be done or whether it is up to the mark.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">4. Launch on App store: After testing, the mobile application is ready to be launched on the App Store so that users can easily download it and use it.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">5. Marketing: When the Application is launched in the market, the next steps is marketing. Without marketing, it is difficult to reach to your target customers. With the help of social media, marketing can be done in cost-effective ways and large audience can be covered.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">6. Customer Support and Upgrading: The last step is the most important one. Once the application is launched in the market, it is the responsibility of the developer to keep upgrading its application according to the present scenario and provide customer support to its users if they have any difficulty in using the application.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\" align=\"left\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\">With the changing scenario, the lifestyle of people is also changing.
