It was first presented by Sundar Pichai CEO, of the tech giant, Google. It was made keeping in mind the latest <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/android-apps-developer\">Android<\/a><\/strong> users in 2014.\u202fIt was initially released in the rising market accompanying the budget and lesser powered devices with the Indian market kept in mind but then gradually, it branched into most of the South-Asian countries such as Nepal, Pakistan, Sri-Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Philippines, Indonesia etc.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google teamed up with Micromax, Spice, and Karbon for the launch. But now, the system is available with various ranges of mobiles.\u202fIt does not come with the most advanced Android version, which is the Pie. It accompanies every existing\u202fAndroid version\u202fon which our\u202fphones run on currently, i.e. Android\u202f8 Oreo and above.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although,\ncertain companies are finding it difficult to support previous versions of\nAndroid to be used again because android pie mostly offers irreversible updates\nand any discrepancy can cause complicated issues. The supreme goal of the\nintroduction of Android one is to build a dominated and controlled\u202fGoogle Android\nproducts, which are sold through the other hardware partners and not Google\ndirectly. The focus is on smartphone manufacturing companies who will join\nAndroid one and provide the customers a secure and firm version. Every\nsmartphone will be free from\u202fduplicate applications extra services apps\nbloatware and only include what the manufacturers have put in.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\nmeans the phones won\u2019t contain additional services supplementary keyboards or\nnews apps. Google directly maintained the systems and security of the earliest\nlaunched devices. In 2016 phones with the Android One, were introduced in Japan\nwith the support of Softbank and now it remains to be the best-selling mobiles\nin mobile stores across our country. The most fundamental offering from this\nproduct: according to Google, it is probably the most refined form of Androids\nand it is the most efficient Android version.\u202f <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\nfundamentally includes every positive aspect of Google\u202fplus a concrete\noperating system that is the core. Its phones have their set of features such\nas efficient power conservation tactics by prioritizing background activities\nand leading to a longer battery by google but at the same time, these are quite\ndifferent from pixel phones which come with its off the ordinary features such as\npixel launcher and pixel camera which is unavailable on other devices.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some\nGoogle-controlled\u202fproperties of Android one smartphones include&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google-apps:\nThe device has inbuilt Google apps such as maps duo and YouTube, even\nGoogle-play, with service of security to prevent malware from hijacked\napplications. Basically, it offers every Google service.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google-Assistant:\nAndroid one comes with an upgraded and optimized service of Google Assistant\nwhich can be utilized for calling locating and other purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google support: the manufacturers of the devices only have a small role in managing the phone&#8217;s software and also, they hardly alter the software for Google to easily give out upgrades. Hence, with the devices of this OS get upgrades for two years and three years of Android monthly updates for security claiming the devices that are most secure in the ecosystem. A user would have android Q if he bought the device at Android 8 Oreo. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The updates are really fast reported Nokia users since one doesn\u2019t have to wait for the manufacturer&#8217;s update notification. Update speed is also probably the biggest perks of android one. But recent reports show that the update adoption rates are extremely low, almost 19.2 percent of all active users and android members has opted the option to get Android 8 through upgradation.\u00a0 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Devices\nfor Android One&nbsp; <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardware\nManufacturer support: It provides\u202fsoftware support to hardware parts of a phone\nallowing additional features and respective software. For example, Nokia phone\nmight have their own customized camera with features such as specially set pro\nmodes other than the normal Android camera. The user might be able to capture\nsplendid pictures on their device manufacturers\u2019 camera and also utilize the\nvast experience of default gallery which is Photos to ensure storage high\nquality and other purposes. The HTC u11 added a squeezable frame with the\ncontrolling software. Likewise, speaker, cameras and other hardware parts are\nalso supported by android one.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nokia is the most leading device seller of Android one along with HTC and LG. HTC u11 is the prime handset after that came Nokia 6.1, 7 plus and then LG g7 one. Xiaomi a1, Xiaomi m1, mobile x1, moto x4 general mobile gm6 general mobile gm5 and general mobile gm5 plus has this Android OS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since arrival of \u2018Android Go\u2019 much modern technology which allows maximum Google-based apps on a minimum storage and larger experience on smaller hardware android one was expected to witness a downfall since \u2018Android Go\u2019 seemed to be a slimmer and handier technology for a faster function smartphone but the recurrent upgradations offered and features seems to be keeping it active in market.
