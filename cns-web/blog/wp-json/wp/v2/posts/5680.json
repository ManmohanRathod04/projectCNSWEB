With every passing year, the expectations of the users rise and in a competing market like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/\"><strong>Mobile app development<\/strong><\/a>, keeping the users satisfied is the key to create an impression. Every year witnesses updated UI trends. To keep up with these trends is one of the basic tasks you should be sincere at if you\u2019re looking forward to getting your mobile application more downloads.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is never a guarantee that your new application will face the same rate of getting success in the case like Uber and Amazon. Statistical reports point out how 60 out of 100 applications are hardly downloaded on the phones by the users. To make things worse, statistics also show that of the apps that are downloaded, 21% have been employed only for one time in 2018. Admittedly, there could be numerous reasons why users do not download a mobile application, data storage, and utility being some of them. But it has been found that the absence of user-friendly interface is a major cause for this.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from creating an intuitive user interface, utilizing and adopting the latest design trends for the user interface that alters frequently is also a significant measure. Mere updating of your mobile application twice a year may not bring you to the desired position, given the competition that prevails in the market. The following are some of the latest trends in designing a user interface that could aid you in being ahead of the race.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.\n<strong>Using the Illustrations that explain for themselves<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">Engaging through high-quality content is now an out-dated version of introducing them to your app\u2019s features. Try the same by telling a story. This has been proved to be more efficient and less time to consume for the users to receive the information that you are trying to convey. Illustrating the features and functionalities of your mobile app can even be through the depiction of characters that are similar to humans for fruitful interactions with the people using the app. This makes your app more vibrant, favorable and interactive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.\n<strong>Being Transparent<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the tried and tested method of increasing the impact of the interface of the app is to add opacity to boost the transparency of the application. Use a variety of settings for transparency to accomplish a beautiful surface design. This feature can be used to design the app logo as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.\n<strong>Interface that is flawless<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature should be treated with the utmost priority in case of a mobile application development team. The best mobile app is one that reaches out to the targeted audience and gives them a great experience. Your page should load systematically and that the viewers get to the important content right from the beginning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4.\n<strong>Employing the Impacts Wisely<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use of the overlapping feature for fonts and designs are critical. It makes the user interface look more spacious and furnished. This is a widely used tool by the designers, and it is recommended that you combine features along with shadows for an enhanced <strong>UI UX designing<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.\n<strong>Pictures that fill the screen<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming to the forefront in recent times is the trend of using the design components and to employ them as fully \u2013 scaled images that fill the screen. This component has the intensity to appeal to a huge audience effectively. While <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">theuser<\/g> tries to retrieve more information about your app, he will browse <g class=\"gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"9\" data-gr-id=\"9\">throughdifferent<\/g> pages, and these pictures would make such browsing more refreshing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.\n<strong>Employ Colors Intelligently<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colors speak louder than words, especially in the design of the UI of a mobile application. It is the easiest and convenient ways of exhibiting your creativity and designing skills. Colors play an important role in the design of a mobile application, which has an equal impact as that of background images. It grabs the attention and helps to set the artistic tone of the app. Even <g class=\"gr_ gr_11 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"11\" data-gr-id=\"11\">theexperts<\/g> of the market like Whatsapp and Instagram keep renovating their <g class=\"gr_ gr_12 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"12\" data-gr-id=\"12\">colorcombinations<\/g> to give their UI a fresh look.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>7.\n<strong>UI Without Buttons<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome to 2019! Now the <strong>UI Trends<\/strong> of a mobile app would not need buttons to navigate the user. An example of this is the Instagram stories; you don\u2019t have to press anything to shift between the stories and change them, it changes by itself. This has made the UI more user-friendly and convenient for usage than ever before. Even the e-commerce applications do not have separate buttons to add items to the cart these days: all you have to do is drag the product on to the checkout cart.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>8.\n<strong>Usage of&nbsp; Animations<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">Theseplay<\/g> an important role in the design of a UI, particularly for a mobile application. Designers are looking forward to more communications and the animations for functionals in 2019 to represent fonts and images.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>9.\n<strong>Voice Assist<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 2019 just a few weeks away, interfaces with voice &#8211; assists have become application becomes a convenient way of guiding the users throughout the mobile app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.\n<strong>Images of heroes in the landing pages<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themain pictures are usually placed at the top portion of the app UI and are asignificant part of a <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/iPhone-UI-UX-Development\">UI UX development<\/a><\/strong> \u00a0interface. They describe the functions andfeatures of the application as a whole. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>11.<strong> Navigation Becomes Smoother<\/strong>\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the advancements in the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/ui-ux-design\">UI UX Development Company<\/a><\/strong> designs, navigation through your mobile application becomes faster and simpler.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a proficient team which develops mobile apps, one should prepare for the challenges of the upcoming year by focusing more on the app designing rather than researching the latest<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":5685,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_bbp_topic_count":0,"_bbp_reply_count":0,"_bbp_total_topic_count":0,"_bbp_total_reply_count":0,"_bbp_voice_count":0,"_bbp_anonymous_reply_count":0,"_bbp_topic_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_reply_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_forum_subforum_count":0},"categories":[228,225],"tags":[1962,1960,1961,1963],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.1.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Welcome to 2019!
