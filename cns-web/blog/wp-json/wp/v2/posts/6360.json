Of all Android and iOS are the highly opted platforms, and developing the same app for both the platforms separately or developing native mobile applications requires enough time and money. However, the entrepreneurs look for quick mobile app development services to save their time and money and instead invest them in the market. To resolve this problem <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/cross-platform-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"cross-platform mobile app development (opens in a new tab)\">cross-platform mobile app development<\/a><\/strong> is used to save time and money while developing a mobile app.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cross-platform app is developed to run an app on different operating systems.&nbsp; Such applications are developed by writing a single codebase which is deployed across all platforms. It offers a bunch of benefits like faster development, lower development cost, and broader audience reach to make it a cost-effective approach. It provides rich UI experience, easy integration and maintenance, and offline support. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>There is a list of cross-platform frameworks for app development that are well established and have significant features:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h3>Flutter App Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/flutter-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Flutter (opens in a new tab)\">Flutter<\/a><\/strong> was announced by Google in February 2018 that opens the door to developing applications for Android, and iOS with just one codebase. It is an open-source mobile user interface framework and is based on the Dart programming language. With its Hot Reload feature, it enables the developers to see real-time changes in the application while developing the app, which helps in fixing bugs and carry on the development in the right direction. It is robust and can produce complex multifunctional widgets with its broad capabilities for the app. Most of all, Google provides it a large community of developers to support the development of next-generation solutions. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>PhoneGap App Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"PhoneGap (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/phonegap-app-development\" target=\"_blank\">PhoneGap<\/a><\/strong> is an open source cloud-based Adobe\u2019s cross-platform app development framework. It is based on Apache Cordova. With this framework, the developers build the app in JavaScript, <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/HTML5-CSS-Designing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"HTML5 (opens in a new tab)\">HTML5<\/a><\/strong>, and CSS for leading operating systems. It allows the developer to add required functionality and plug-ins without facing any hardware restrictions as it doesn\u2019t depend on the device\u2019s native features and its performance. The framework has earned massive demand due to its features and support it offers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Kotlin App Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Kotlin (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/kotlin-app-development\" target=\"_blank\">Kotlin<\/a><\/strong> is an open source language based on JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and was designed to address the issue of Java. It has several benefits like it takes lesser coding than Java to implement a feature, which enhances the development time and improves its execution. Kotlin offers inter-operability that makes it easy to use its features on the existing project without changing its previous codes.&nbsp; Thus, it can co-exist with Java on the same project. Its system detects bugs and errors in real time and makes it robust and saves costs that are spent on fixing the bugs. With all its features along with a steeper learning curve, it is a good option for <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"cross-platform (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cross-platform_software\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>cross-platform<\/strong><\/a> development of applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ionic App Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/ionic-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Iconic framework (opens in a new tab)\">Iconic framework<\/a><\/strong> is a famous name in the field of cross-platform app development. It makes use of technologies like HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. With a powerful CLI, it can code, test and deploy an application to the required platform. Its primary coding language is TypeScript which is a superset of JavaScript that makes it easy to detect errors while coding and results in better quality code. All of its features, with inbuilt elements, and a large community of developers have made it one of the frameworks that can build native-like mobile apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Titanium App Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/titanium-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Titanium  (opens in a new tab)\">Titanium<\/a><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/titanium-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Titanium  (opens in a new tab)\"> <\/a>allows the developer to create, run and pack native mobile apps for Android and iOS with the help of cross-platform application program interface like JavaScript. It helps in writing code for a native app but using a portable, cross-platform JavaScript code. Titanium consists of Titanium SDK, Appcelerator CLI, Titanium API\u2019s and Modules and so on. It helps developers to use their ability to code in JavaScript to develop native-like mobile apps that are deployed on multiple platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Xamarin app development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Microsoft owns <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Xamarin (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/xamarin-app-development\" target=\"_blank\">Xamarin<\/a><\/strong>, one of the popular cross-platform frameworks that work on the principle of write once and deploys it on any platform. It has allowed the developers to design native apps using the C# code base and then use the same IDE, language, and APIs everywhere. The framework develops an application that delivers native app-like experience, and the apps are attractive. It offers the facility to reuse the code, and its tools and functions make it apt for rapid app development. It has been used for more than 15 thousand companies now. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sencha App Development<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/sencha-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Sencha app development (opens in a new tab)\">Sencha app development<\/a><\/strong> platform is an excellent choice for cross-platform mobile app framework which is used to develop apps using the hardware acceleration technologies. The applications built with Sencha are highly tested, tightly- integrated UI elements and libraries. It can create significant business apps and maintain them with ease. It even supports the PhoneGap\/Cordova integration for native application program interface to access and packaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"mobile app development (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\" target=\"_blank\">mobile app development<\/a><\/strong> world, the cross-platform frameworks are the tools to develop mobile applications.
