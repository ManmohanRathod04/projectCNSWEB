The goal apparently will be to locate which apps and features\nFacebook must copy, buy, and what is to be ignored. Periodically, the company\nwill remind the participants to review the information they share with\nFacebook. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Here is the data Facebook will gather and\ninterpret:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Apps installed on the phone of the\nparticipants<\/li><li>The time you spend using these apps in a day<\/li><li>Participant\u2019s nation, device &amp; network\ntype<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/viewpoints.fb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Facebook's Viewpoints (opens in a new tab)\">Facebook&#8217;s Viewpoints<\/a><\/strong>, a new market research app launched by Facebook a couple of days ago, a couple of months after the organization introduced the Android data collection app named Study. The app is designed with a view for monitoring what and to which extent the users can access different software on the Google-owned operating system.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both applications have a dubious history.\nFacebook had to shut down a market research app in January, the app which the company\nintroduced as a virtual private network (VPN) provider in the market. It was\nadvertised to teenagers, and it employed a special software certificate that\nApple gives to businesses. It was chiefly structured to authorize the\ndistribution of internal apps within the employees only (no general public to\nbe involved).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Over the years, Facebook&#8217;s Market Research apps have violated Apple&#8217;s Privacy Guidelines<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook was using it for installing software on the phones of\nteens along with the survey partakers for collecting the information which the\norganization generally could not ask for, employing its basic iOS applications.\nThe app would have overlooked Apple&#8217;s principles for the App Store. However, to\ndistribute the software outside the standard iOS model, Facebook was using an\nApple-provided enterprise certificate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple drew the organization&#8217;s enterprise privileges of Facebook\nfor violating the guidelines, and as a result of which Facebook has shut down\nthe application, named Facebook Research VPN, for appeasing the makers of the\niPhone. Even last year also, Facebook had to shut down a similar VPN app\nreferred to as the &#8216;Onavo Protect.&#8217; The app was shut down after Apple said the\napp is violating the standard App Store data collection rules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook&#8217;s examination endeavors presently live on in Viewpoints\nand Study. With Viewpoints, Facebook is not peering into how you utilize\nthird-party applications. Instead, it is an app that will give you rewards for\nfilling the surveys, testing new items, and much more. As per Facebook, the\nfirst survey is the &#8220;Well-Being Survey,&#8221; which will take around 15\nminutes and acquire you 1000 &#8220;points,&#8221; which means $5 that will be\npaid to you through PayPal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook appears to have taken a few reactions of its past\nmarket research app to heart, as Viewpoints is open to individuals of 18 and above\nin the US with Facebook accounts. Still, when some of you try registering a\nFacebook account on the iOS version of the app, you may receive a pop-up\nmessage of &#8216;not available to you at this time,&#8217; so it seems that some people\nprobably won&#8217;t qualify all requirements for the current survey.\n\nFacebook says that it\nintends to give &#8220;extra ways for individuals to get you enrolled&#8221; and\nto extend the program to different nations next year. The company also stated\nit wouldn&#8217;t share information from the application to third parties. Along with\nthat company also promised that it would not share your Facebook Viewpoints\nactivity on Facebook.\n\n\n\n<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In consonance with Facebook\u2019s official blog, this all is going to take place: Facebook is going to run ads for encouraging selected people to take part in the market research<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":7421,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_bbp_topic_count":0,"_bbp_reply_count":0,"_bbp_total_topic_count":0,"_bbp_total_reply_count":0,"_bbp_voice_count":0,"_bbp_anonymous_reply_count":0,"_bbp_topic_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_reply_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_forum_subforum_count":0},"categories":[2378],"tags":[2341,2376,2377,2374,2375],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.1.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"After shutting down VPN service, Facebook now launched a new market research app, Viewpoints: It\u2019s beginning with a well-being survey.
