Right from the flip mobile phones to keypad phones to QWERTY phones to touch screens now, everything has completely changed in different ways. For about the past 2 years, the entire business has been revolving around the foldable mobile phones and this will continue to create a remarkable history in the coming years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today,<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Foldable_smartphone\"><b> <strong>foldable mobile phones<\/strong><\/b><\/a> are been apart from other types of mobile phones that have grabbed the attention of users in less amount of time and have completely blend the devices that result in the excitement of users. When these mobile phones are not in use, they can be folded into the small pocket size and can be opened with a larger screen when using.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the\nreport from Global device forecast, by the year 2023, the foldable mobile\nphones will present 5% of high-end smartphones in the market which led to the\ngrowth of businesses. Primarily because of the high costs involved, the world\ntech is dived when it comes to the success of foldable mobile phones in coming\nnear future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Impact of foldable mobile phones on the development process<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The increase in the number of mobile phones (foldable phones) has impacted directly the process of development in today\u2019s competitive scenario. It is a fact that how a mobile app is developed for a single screen is absolutely different from how a mobile app is developed for both small and large screens. The developers will certainly have to focus on several factors like the configuration, size and more while developing mobile apps for two different screens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire process gets altered when it comes to designing parts of the screens. Sometimes, people generally seem that it is easy and flexible to solve the problems with UI\/UX designs and for larger screens, it might be complicated at some point in time. To begin with, the developers will provide the best and more immersive experience for the users because they have a multi-window with the foldable mobile phones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/mobile-apps-for-foldable-large-screens-mobile-devices-1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7580\" width=\"665\" height=\"380\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the best<strong> <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"mobile UI\/UX development company (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/ui-ux-design\" target=\"_blank\">mobile UI\/UX development company<\/a><\/strong>, it is important to understand the needs of the users and work accordingly on the mobile application development process. &nbsp;Not only the video streaming apps but also the live content and major streaming services are offered by foldable mobile phones in a larger format for the user\u2019s convexity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Major features to build mobile apps for foldable and larger screen devices<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we know that foldable mobile phones offer immersive user experience and therefore, the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"mobile app development (opens in a new tab)\">mobile app development<\/a><\/strong> becomes more innumerable for the users. Let us have a look at some of the major steps that one should keep in mind while building mobile apps for foldable and larger screen mobile devices:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>App Continuity<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important for foldable mobile phones to give the transition from one screen to another that will satisfy the users with greater experience and will result in better outcomes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Resizable<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the crucial factors that foldable mobile phone has is resizable that makes these mobile phones easy to use and handy to carry. This will help you to ensure the maximum compatibility factor no matter what the environmental functionality is.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Screen Ratio<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure compatibility with the number of devices, the\nmobile apps must be tested on as many screens as possible and in different\nscreen ratios which makes the content or videos or any other stuff valuable and\nconvenient for the users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Multi-Window<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-window another best feature that foldable mobile phones\nhave and is advised to have the multiple applications that are running side by\nside when the phone is expanded to its larger size and is running at the same\ntime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Multi-Resume<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the major points that developers should focus upon while working on foldable mobile phones that the multi-resume feature is important on either way. This is done especially to help the apps which run the content or would either get paused whenever a mobile app is not focusing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Multi-Display<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The future might seem to be that the foldable mobile phones\nhave more features more than one screen at one time and this configuration\nmight alter or can be safely handled in the same way like the developer works\non projected screens for Chrome OS.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Multi-Display Support<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The surface of android app development is independently drawn away that is one of the most important factors one (developer) must cover and understand. Hence, the multi-display support will allow users for a better user experience. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Foldable Testing<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you sure that your mobile phone (foldable phone) is ready to be released or not? Then, perform the testing option in it before you release them. Therefore, as a <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/hire-mobile-app-developer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"mobile app developer (opens in a new tab)\">mobile app developer<\/a><\/strong> you must cross-check configuration changes, multi-window and multi-resume, resizing and screen ratios in a better way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to mobile application development either for the <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"android app development (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/android-application-development\" target=\"_blank\">android app development<\/a> <\/strong>or iOS app development platform, there are several challenges and multiple factors to consider at the time of the development process. Hence, it completely depends upon the users&#8217; requirements what they or their business is looking for in what sort of budget.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As we all know that the increase in demand for mobile phones has drastically changed from the past few years.
