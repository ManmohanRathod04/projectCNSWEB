Therefore, the level of struggle is also very high. In order to get their applications featured in the main app stores, it is essential for a developer to test the quality of the software before submitting it for evaluation or introducing it in the marketplace. Mobile application testing leads to improve user understanding and all software development companies must test their applications across multiple OS platforms, browsers, and Smartphone models. Here we discuss different ways in which an application can be tested:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><!--more--><\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify\">1. Connectivity Testing:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">\u00a0In this type of mobile application testing, the developer must observe whether their software can identify network connections such as 2G, 3G, 4G Edges or Wi-Fi.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify\">2. Cross Platform Testing:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The mobile application created by the software developer is a cross-platform application then it must be installed on all the main operating systems such as Android, iOS, BlackBerry, and Windows mobile and checked for accuracy of functionality. This type of mobile application testing is also known as Compatibility Testing, where it is seen if a mobile app is compatible with all types of operating systems platforms and the mobile devices they are installed on.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify\">3. Interruption testing:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In this kind of mobile application testing, the application is run on the devices while other functions are being carried out. If the application still operates successfully, it may be launched in the marketplace. Some such interruptions may be recognized as receiving an incoming call, reading or receiving a text message, shutting down the device, low battery conditions, taking pictures with the camera, sending an email or text message, playing games and losing network connectivity for the moment etc.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify\">4. Orientation Testing:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This is a type of mobile application testing for which the application developer has to switch on the mobile gadget in the portrait or the landscape mode. If the application successfully functions in both modes, it is termed as an effective application.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify\">5. Web Service Testing:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This is a type of <span style=\"color: #333333\"><strong><a style=\"color: #333333\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/mobile-application-testing-services-usa.html\">mobile application testing<\/a><\/strong><\/span> in which the developer must be capable to the name, web service language being used in the application and also classify the web server location. This includes checking application features such as seeing the Time Zone etc.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify\">6. Volume Testing:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This is one of the most significant types of mobile application testing as it allows the developer to determine whether the application will function correctly if huge volumes of data are stored in the mobile device<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify\">7. Universal testing:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This is a type of mobile application testing where a mobile app needs to be run in diverse forms of mobile devices for example Smartphones and Tablets. If the features &amp; functionality are accessible in the same way in both kinds of devices, it is termed as a successful mobile application.<\/p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify\">8. Monitoring of battery consumption:<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This is the most important part of <span style=\"color: #333333\"><a style=\"color: #333333\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/Dedicated-QA-Tester.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>mobile application testing<\/strong><\/a><\/span>. It should be conducted irrespective of the application testing method used by the developer to determine the functionality of the mobile application. Checking the level of battery utilization when applications are running on the device is important.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mobile Application Testing: There are thousands of mobile apps selling companies in the market these days.
