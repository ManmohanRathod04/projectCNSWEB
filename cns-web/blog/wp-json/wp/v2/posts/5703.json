It will mark the beginning of the world of wireless 5G network which will work towards supporting in making the perfect combination of data computation with some several millions of devices and that too within some fractions of seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take an example&#8230; the time you need to blink of your eyelids within that short period more than millions of data will get transmitted right from the device you own to uncountable numbers of connected devices of this world.

But do you have any idea as to what 5G actually means to the mobile developers and its millions of end-users who all are looking for benefits with new mobile experiences? Undoubtedly fast mobile internet is something which all surely expects, but is that all? Well, definitely not as it is only one of the many benefits it promised to offer. Before you get an idea as to what are the impacts of 5G you need to understand as to how different it is from 4G via a comparison between 5G vs. 4G.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5G VS 4G: Understanding why 5 G is better: <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5G offers faster fiber comparable speed minus wires<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low in latency \u2013 which means less delay and interference<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offers excellent wireless power which gives the opportunity to allow several devices to stay connected via an IoT network<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Offers brilliant experience with multiple coverage option and facilities<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u2022&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent opportunity with wireless connectivity<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How it is going to benefit the industry of Mobile apps?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent speed:\u00a0 The fast download speed which will represent the 5G technology will make it easier for app users to make fast downloading of apps in friction of second even when the MB size of the selected app is huge. It will be like a genie in the lamp for businesses which are banking on in-app download based monetization plans.\u00a0 <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast Transferring of file: With fast speed, the user can make fast transferring of files, money or absolute anything which is transferable in nature. The 5G mobile app is going to create a revolution for those mobile apps which follow the business module where it needs to make the transfer of money or data from one account to another in the fastest possible time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Latency moved to almost Zero: Delays turn deadly for your business if you\u2019re trying to manage machines for taking critical decisions in the fastest possible time. 5G is promising a feature to offer near-zero latency. The quick app download is something that is much in demand.\u00a0 It is highly beneficial for AR\/VR based mobile apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent user experience: Don\u2019t you feel the above 3 factors are sufficient enough to justify that it\u2019s an ideal choice for the best user experience? One of the biggest advantages with 5G is the clarity it offers in internet speed. The effect you will notice in the app UI will be an elevated one to a large extent when the same is used or streamed using 5G networks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So by this time you are sure now as for how will <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/android-application-development\">Android application<\/a><\/strong> be affected by 5G network in 2019?

The 4G network can max support 2000 devices with its current capacity within .38 square miles. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the increase in the number of devices, you will notice a sudden fall in the capacity as it turns inadequate. But with a 5G network, things will show a rapid change and can manage more than 1 million devices in the same space. This is certainly great news for the developers of IoT (Internet of Things) and for any Mobile App Development Company. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just in a month\u2019s time, we will be entering a new era of technological advancement.
