One of the ways is to use React Native development. React Native is a cross-platform framework that was devised by Facebook and Instagram for iOS and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/android-application-development\">Android app development company<\/a><\/strong> to develop native apps using a single JavaScript codebase.&nbsp; React native also came into being as the developers were facing a challenge in developing large applications where data keeps changing often. React native has grown quite popular among the developers as it builds an attractive UI which cannot be differentiated from the native apps with wonderful colors and logos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reusability of code, pre-developed components and the feature that allows them to create the same app for different applications has made developers take a sigh of relief. Live and hot reloading again save time. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>But what are the reasons that React Native disrupts the iOS and Android development?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Lacks smooth performance<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Till the time React native is concerned with the development of simple applications, it works well. But in apps with added functionality, various issues arise with debugging tools in <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"react development (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/react-js-app-development\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>react development<\/strong><\/a>. Many a time the hot reloading feature fails. Such issues degrade the performance of the applications created under react native as compared to native iOS and Android app development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The need for Native code<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It was expected that with react native there wouldn\u2019t be much need of native codes. On the contrary, specific native codes are required to implement some native functionalities and modules. For example, if the app needs access to a camera or onboard hardware, the lack of support for native app functionalities leads to writing native code while developing apps with React Native. In such a scenario, experienced native iOS and Android app development teams are required to code the functionalities. With such inconvenience, React native no longer remain the pro <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/framework-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"app development framework (opens in a new tab)\">app development framework<\/a><\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Quality code of available components<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>React Native is an\nopen-source framework, which can always choose a component code from\nthird-party libraries. The quality of code from these libraries is always\ndoubtful. Since non-experienced developers write these codes, a lot of time goes\nin correcting the bugs of the code. Instead of error correction, writing the\nnative code from scratch according to the required functionality is always a\nbetter practice. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Low security of JavaScript libraries and memory usage<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript is easy\nto jailbreak. In case of developing apps with react native which need a type A\nsecurity, like banking apps and finance apps, JavaScript is not much secure. In\nthe presence of third-party features, there is a need to keep a check on the\nfalse codes that can break the security of the application. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript again\ndoesn\u2019t provide an environment that is best suitable for computational apps.\nThe speed and performance of the application with react native go down while\nmaking computations in terms of memory management.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion<\/strong> <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The above features weaken the reputation of React Native framework when it comes to developing large, computation intensive apps. React Native is any time better for small and straightforward <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.ae\/services\/android-application-development.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"android app development (opens in a new tab)\">android app development<\/a><\/strong>. The framework grows and improves with time. It is expected to give better results in the future.&nbsp; As of now, the react native is relatively immature as compared to native iOS and Android app development. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In today\u2019s time, having a business app for the company and brand is a must, and development of the respective cross-platform app is equally essential.
