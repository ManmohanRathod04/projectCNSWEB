And as you read this, thousand other application ideas are either being conceived or in pipeline ready to be launched on the store. Designing and executing an application are two crucial phases in iPhone apps, wherein both are inter-dependent. So unless your design is solid, shaping up your application can give you sleepless nights. Don\u2019t worry; this blog has got you covered to start-off with your iPhone apps.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Here is a list of essential elements to remember while designing an iPhone Apps:<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Maturity of the platform<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">3D touch, multi-tasking, new fonts, auto layout, stack views and adaptive layouts are some of your handy tools and techniques for an advanced and perfectly compatible iPhone application. Make sure to use them wisely while setting up the base design of your application.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Points &amp; Pixels<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The device iPhone has primarily four resolutions-\u00a0320 x 480 pt(iPhone 4),\u00a0320 x 568 pt\u00a0(iPhone 5),\u00a0375 x 667 pt\u00a0(iPhone 7) and\u00a0414 x 736 pt\u00a0(iPhone 7 Plus). While designing the application for iPhone, it should be remembered that the layout doesn\u2019t scale itself but expands based on the assigned resolution. Additionally, elements inside it remain intact. So, a design should be such that it transcends and adapts to the screen resolution for which the points and pixels are of utmost importance.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">App Icon<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">The branding of the app is fulfilled by the app\u2019s icon and so is an indispensable element while designing an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/iPhone-Development\">iPhone Application<\/a>. Since it\u2019s the first thing that your users will see, it should be convincing enough about what your application is. Plus, it appears on multiple places like Home Screen, the App Store, in spotlight and in settings. So it is advisable to work ardently on its icon design, icon grid, colors and shape.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify\">Sketch it up<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Visualizing pre-hand and sketching up the layout of the app is very useful while execution comes into picture. Pictures and jot on the paper as how the app would look like, what information it would present, the interface it is going to provide and the flow of information, images, text, etc. Sketching will make your task easy and you\u2019ll be right on your schedule too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">So, there you go. Get started with your application. Good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>iPhone Apps According to Statistic, as of June 2016 Apple\u2019s App Store has over two million apps available to download, making it the second largest application store in the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":3520,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_bbp_topic_count":0,"_bbp_reply_count":0,"_bbp_total_topic_count":0,"_bbp_total_reply_count":0,"_bbp_voice_count":0,"_bbp_anonymous_reply_count":0,"_bbp_topic_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_reply_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_forum_subforum_count":0},"categories":[231],"tags":[270,42,452,1303],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.1.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"iOS is considered a major mobile OS after Android.
