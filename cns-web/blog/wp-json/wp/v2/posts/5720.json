This marks as a new phase of development and it won\u2019t be late now that some really advanced applications will venture into the market. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The focuses to develop these kits have been to reduce the pressure on implementing large data sets which are typically required for AI and ML development. Both Apple and Google have released the kits keeping <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/Dedicated-iOS-Developer\"><strong>developers<\/strong><\/a> in mind who are not very proficient in their coding. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First,\nlet us look at Apple\u2019s machine language it and following that the Google\u2019s and\ncompare which one is better.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple&#8217;s Core ML 2<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This\nallows a robust integration of different models in machine learning. Using this\nframework, it is possible for developers to write machine learning applications\nwith the least code possible. According to Apple, this Core ML 2 is 30% faster\nthanks to the capability of batch prediction and it can compress the models in\nmachine learning by almost 75%. Batch prediction is the process of identifying\nseveral images at the same time, rather than trying to predict each of the\nimage one by one. The models in machine learning can be compressed by\nrepresenting the weights in fewer bits. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/framework-development\"><strong>framework<\/strong><\/a> for development allows the usage of deep and convoluted neural networks. and they support the different ree models as well as linear regression. This new version of the Core ML can also load the different models from cloud platforms such as the AWS and Microsoft Azure during the runtime. The Core ML is built on low \u2013 level technologies and thus, it ensures the minimal usage of the CPU and GPU while providing the maximum efficiency. The developers can almost run all their ML models onto the device so that the data will not be needed to leave the device, according to Apple. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple\nalso said during the release by stating an example of a company called Memrise\nwho have used the machine learning framework to build a website where people\nlearn multiple languages. During the past, the developers would take almost 24\nhours to train their AI to identify 20,000 images but with these frameworks,\nthe time is brought down to just around 48 minutes. Also, the size of the\nmodels of the machine learning is brought down from somewhere around 90\nmegabytes to just around 3 megabytes. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The\nMachine Learning Kit from Google<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the conference by Google during the last month, they released this kit for developers who are not very strong with the implementations of Machine learning models. It is a type of cross-platform development framework along with the firebase development platform. Creating the ML requires a lot of work, as you will need to learn how to determine the exact weights, to use the different libraries and also acquire the sufficient training data to even build the most simple of the models. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the Firebase and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/android-application-development\"><strong>Android development<\/strong><\/a> kit makes it very easy for the developers to implement their models by allowing only some features of the machine learning to be called on the fire-base platform.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Google, one would not have to have the deep knowledge about deep <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">neaural<\/g> network and model optimization if they need to use this framework; they can achieve the task in a short span of time using minimal lines of code. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nframework supports certain ML features such as scanning the barcode, landmark,\nfacial and text detection. Also, this model helps operate in both offline and\nonline conditions. For instance, the offline version will be able to identify a\nparticular image as that of a dog while the online version will be able to\nspecify the breed of the dog as well. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So\nwhich one is the right for you?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing\nbetween these developmental kits at the end of the day is purely a preference\nof the developer. The developmental kit from Google, although it is still in\nthe Beta version, offers so much for even the amateur developer through the use\nof models, and pre-exists that if you want to get into the world of machine\nlearning quicker, then this must be the option for you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On\nthe other hand, Apple\u2019s framework is not as efficient as that of Google fist,\nmainly because it does not operate on multiple platforms. And second, it can\nonly be operated on iOS devices and also is not a cross-platform suite which\ndecreases its efficiency. But Apple has been claiming that their second apple\nupdates the developmental kit is more efficient. It is to be waited and seen if\nthat is truly the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from these two, there are core machine language kits released from both Intel and NVidia. The former is free of cost and is great for students and scientists to test and conduct experiments related to machine learning. The latter on the other hand is a great tool for advanced users of Machine learning. Make sure that you choose the right one according to your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking to develop or design a Mobile application, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/\"><strong>contact us<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>for any support.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The last two months have been exciting for developers as both rivals, Apple and Google introduced their Machine Learning Kits named Apple\u2019s Core ML 2 &amp; Google&#8217;s ML kit.
