Now the smartphones come with\ninbuilt social media apps that allow for messaging, video calling and posting\nvideos. But there are many more options in your store that you shouldn&#8217;t miss\nout on. Here are the latest trending social media apps that you can use on both\nAndroid and iOS.&nbsp; If you are looking for an <a href=\"https:\/\/appsquadz.com\/\"><strong>app development company<\/strong><\/a>, then you might want to consider that which has worked with\nthe following apps:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.\nTelegram:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With\nmore than a million active users, Telegram has been declared the fastest\nmessaging app.&nbsp; It lets you store chat\nhistory in the cloud and share files of any size, and the chats are protected\nwith Diffie-Hellman secure key exchange.&nbsp;\nTelegram supports GIFs, stickers, photo and video editing, and group\nchats with even 1,00,000 people. This free app doesn&#8217;t annoy you with\nadvertisements and promises that it will remain free.&nbsp; Funded by a donation, Telegram is funded by a\ndonation and they have declared that they will not sell user data and that\ngeneration of revenue isn&#8217;t its motive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.\nYouTube:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might seem like YouTube is an outdated app and would not be anywhere on the trending <a href=\"https:\/\/appsquadz.com\/social-networking-mobile-app-development\"><strong>social media apps<\/strong><\/a> list, but believe me when I say that it has been visited by teens almost twice in the past three years. With the brand-new vlogger base and a strong influencer instead of a mere passive content consumption website, YouTube has remained the teens\u2019 favorite. It was voted the most popular social app in 2018 among the American teens aged between 13 to 18. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.\nFacebook:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\nis undeniably one of the most widely used social networking sites in the world\nand one of the largest as well.

It even lets you promote your business and products using paid\nFacebook ads. It even has its own messaging app called Messenger which is a\nconvenient platform to chat, voice call and video call with your friends and\nfamily. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it has breached the trust of millions of its users when it gave third parties access to the personal data of 87 million users. This led to the #deletefacebook campaign which encourages people to remove themselves from Facebook and use other networks instead. Many companies ask for custom Facebook like app development for their businesses, both <a href=\"https:\/\/appsquadz.com\/iPhone-Development\"><strong>iOS app development <\/strong><\/a>of this kind and <a href=\"https:\/\/appsquadz.com\/android-application-development\"><strong>Android app development<\/strong><\/a> of this kind can be done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.\nInstagram:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although\nFacebook has reigned over the field of photo-sharing on the internet, Instagram\nhas become more popular on mobile devices.
