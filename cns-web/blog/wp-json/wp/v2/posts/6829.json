Here we will talk about the modern technology named\nWireless Sensor Network system, which was only possible due to the tremendous\ngrowth of Near Field Communication. This system uses smartphones to carry out\nan extensive array of recreation &amp; business activities on all the possible\nlevels allows users to conduct payments and transactions over mobile phones. With\nthis, the requirement for smartphones that imbibe NFC is augmenting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is NFC?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"NFC (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Near-field_communication\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>NFC<\/strong><\/a>, i.e. Near Field Communication, is a&nbsp;wireless communication technology that via RFID readers and&nbsp;beacons lets users transmit the data among various devices that are located far away from one another. Since it is low energy and low-cost communication technology, it enables end-users to carry out the transactions without any nuisance. NFC focuses on customized communication by facilitating secured complex data transmission within the users in a less intrusive way. Along with this, NFC empowers retailers to magnify the in-store experience &amp; knowledge too so that they cope with the endless competition.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ease\nof use and time are two aspects that shape up consumers&#8217; tastes &amp;\npreferences. Buyers visit retail shops as they don&#8217;t prefer waiting for their\norders to arrive at their doorsteps or they favor online purchasing as it is\npretty handy. Furthermore, the chief purpose is to make it amazingly easy for\nend-users to complete the buying process of products\/merchandise. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>NFC\napplies electromagnetic radiations to transfer data within the devices, i.e.\nbeacons or RFID tags that, in turn, assist users in bringing out the\ntransactions hassle-free. In order to intensify the payment experience, a few\nnumbers of markets across Asia, Japan, and Europe have started using&nbsp;NFC.\nHowever, there is still a room to embrace this technology and people are\nsupposed to implement it extensively.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Benefits of integrating NFC in mobile apps<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Offers augmented shopping experience&nbsp;to customers: <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zap tap employs NFC technology efficiently by connecting users to WebPages that highlight product\/service data.<strong> <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Enhances customer service<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>By taking away the hassles of paying at stores and performing productive processes, it enhances customer service. A single NFC tap from smartphones can resolve difficulties within a few seconds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Added security<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In case, your&nbsp;smartphone is robbed and you have added security to your wallet, the two-step authentication method prevents your money from getting fraud.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Improved convenience<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For faster payments, NFC expedites up the payment method for the customers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cuts down the operational cost<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With NFC, the operational cost is mitigated as the alternate payment processing system preserves money on paper and human resource deployment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Implementing NFC for payment system <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is anticipated that NFC payment systems will be seeing an exponential growth soon. NFC has brought in a significant change in the retail sector since the moment Google launched NFC-oriented&nbsp;wallet payment systems. An NFC-oriented wallet payment system facilitates the users to carry out payment or transactions at retail stores with just a few taps on smartphones. In 2012, the retail sector attached NFC devices within commodity tags and ensemble stores with mirrors that are digitally driven to heighten customers&#8217; experience. The innovation let them observe how each dress is crafted when they try it out facing the mirror. Multiple payment solutions can be generated that will affect the process of paying and make it easier at every NFC point with the assistance of NFC. Nowadays, numerous retail stores, petrol pump stations, and restaurants have adopted contactless payment system via smartphones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>NFC in mobile apps<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As already said, the scope of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/know-things-developing-mobile-payment-apps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"mobile payment app (opens in a new tab)\">mobile payment app<\/a><\/strong> has progressed at an exponential pace due to the massive growth of NFC infrastructure, and it won&#8217;t see a downfall shortly. These payments provide end-users with a profoundly gratifying experience as they are based out of extremely intuitive UI. This type of payment system will grow as there is a presence of different innovative components and many business prototypes which ensures the same. To be capable of making contactless payments, the users are must install the concerned applications on their Android phones. Various apps, such as Boon facilitate end-users to make non-contact payments. Once you are done with the download, you have to register yourself, and after that, you can carry out transactions efficiently in a short-term period. It heavily depends upon prepaid MasterCard and also presents users with a transparent vision of all the transactions and payments done. Additionally, the user may also scan the NFC tag to retrieve vital information, and all this is made secure with PIN protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Utilizing NFC effectively<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Loads\nof departmental store in the US practice NFC&nbsp;to facilitate users and being\ninformed of the latest styles and shades they offer. Besides that, it also\nenabled them to examine if the products are in stock on online platforms or\nnot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon-Ton\nimplemented NFC in more than 30 stores.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bon-Ton\ngot positive feedbacks from customers, with the implementation of NFC in a few\nstores and users enjoyed the process of using NFC and discovered it beneficial.\nOne more feature of NFC grabbed people&#8217;s attention to a large extent, and it\nwas the ease of its usage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Security concerns<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Security\nhas been the concern for the parties involved in the transaction irrespective\nof the mode of the payment. No matter what the mode of payment is, there are\nalways security concerns, especially with electronic payment methods. So let us\nsee what the serious concerns associated with NFC are.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Eavesdropping<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Eavesdropping\nis a phenomenon which happens when someone intercepts and gets the data.\nHowever, this threat is least with NFC as the devices are to be placed closely\nto transmit signals, and these signals are hard to catch. The data is encrypted\nand decrypted with an approved device, in case of NFC based payments. NFC chips\nare not active always; they are only active when you want them to be active. It\nmeans when your phone is locked; the NFC devices don&#8217;t transfer data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Data manipulation<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\narises if someone attempts to corrupt or manipulate the NFC transmission data\ncommunication, yet this risk can be mitigated adequately with the use of secure\nchannels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Device theft<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once\nyour device is stolen, then that person can make payments through NFC, and no\nencryption can protect you. Though this can be taken care of by some simple\nsteps and one of them is to set-up a pass code. Devices having features like\nfingerprinting scan or lock help in eliminating the risk of NFC misuse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Security measures<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All\nthe security mentioned above concerns is strictly observed and are dealt with\nappropriate security measures. The security measures stated below are inherent\nand made to provide that added layer of security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Proximity<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In&nbsp;NFC Technology, the devices must be connected inside 4 cm to communicate. Because of this proximity, it becomes hardened or impossible for cybercriminals to execute their attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>HCE<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>HCE, also known as host card emulation emulates the physical card. It saves the secure account information on the cloud rather than storing it in the device. Android Pay operates on HCE to perform protected mobile payment transactions<strong>.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Secure element<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>NFC\nruns within a safe part which is in the form of a tamper-resistant chip\nconsisting of sensitive data in it. In NFC payments, the protected components\nare saved in the device, and it interacts with NFC-enabled receiver to perform\nthe transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Final thought<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>NFC technology is assisting many sectors for secure payment or transactions. Also, it simplifies the process of conducting a contactless payment. With NFC, users can keep their card information secures on their phones and pay in just a few taps on the smart phone\u2019s screen or close to the NFC reader. It has not as yet adopted by many, but undoubtedly, it is going to achieve user acceptance at a more general level.
