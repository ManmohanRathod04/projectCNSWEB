A few overhauls to the sneak peak turned out before Marshmallow was authoritatively named on August 17. Google at last revealed Android 6.0 Marshmallow, close by the 2015 Nexus gadgets, on September 29, 2015.

This is especially an instance of being diverse instead of better, yet it scrolls snappily on the Nexus 6 we&#8217;ve been utilizing. Those with huge application accumulations may think that its speedier. What&#8217;s more, as in Android Lollipop, the applications are organized one after another in order as opposed to giving you a chance to move them about yourself.
