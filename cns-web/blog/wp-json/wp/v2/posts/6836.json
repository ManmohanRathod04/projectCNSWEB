You have numerous options like Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, and many more for back-end development. Still, in between these which one is the best for your mobile app development project? If you are well-versed with the pros and cons of the technologies, the task of picking between Ruby and other frameworks become more comfortable. In this article, we will start with what is Ruby used for and when it is best applied. Read onto the topic if you don&#8217;t know about Ruby on Rails development framework.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before discussing what Ruby on Rails is used for, I will first address the history and the idea after the creation of Ruby, and what Ruby on Rails is. The purpose of ROR usually confuses, and here I will make it clear for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Ruby, and where is it used?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The principal distinction in Ruby and Ruby on Rails is hidden in their purpose. Ruby is the programming language developed in the 1990s whose main task is fast creation of new projects with high performance. Ruby is a general-purpose programming language like C++ and PHP which is suitable for a wide array of programming tasks. Since 2002, the language has had 1,082 releases and demonstrated excellent results in its repository. This language is being developed steadily and surrounded by a large community. The main advantages of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ruby_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Ruby programming language (opens in a new tab)\">Ruby programming language<\/a><\/strong> are widespread community support, user-friendliness, integrity, readability, compliance, and community gems- coding scripts that simplify the development process. Still, building applications practicing only Ruby is a tedious job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ruby on Rails- Overview<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind Ruby&#8217;s popularity, Rails or Ruby on Rails is named as the chief cause. ROR founded in 2003 is again an <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"open-source framework (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/opensource-cms-development\" target=\"_blank\">open-source framework<\/a> <\/strong>written in Ruby programming language. The creation of ROR was for programmer comfort and elegant code. While web application development, Ruby on Rails development company doesn&#8217;t have to rewrite every single code which decreases time consumed on primary tasks. ROR framework simplifies the process of web app development and mobile app development by taking repetitive tasks off the developers&#8217; shoulders like the creation of forms, tables, and menus. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/hire-mobile-app-developer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Mobile app developers (opens in a new tab)\">Mobile app developers<\/a><\/strong> don&#8217;t have to create a new web app or mobile app from scratch as for everyday repetitive tasks they can utilize out-of-the-box solutions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why Ruby on Rails is so popular <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruby\non Rails is a trendy framework and has been amongst the top five most popular\nframeworks for back-end development. The number of websites developed with ROR\naccounts for more than 350000 globally, and these figures are increasing at a\nconstant pace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ruby on Rails: Popularity across Industries<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are selecting the right back-end framework, open-source status is the first thing to take into consideration. Ruby on Rails is open-source which means it is free and can be accessed by anyone without paying any additional charges. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/hire-ruby-on-rails-developer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Ruby on Rails developers (opens in a new tab)\">Ruby on Rails developers<\/a><\/strong> can download the source code for further practice in the applications they are working on. Since it is open-source, you can also subscribe to the development and success of the framework. If you think that some of the features can make it more useful, you can suggest your contribution to consent. Ruby on Rails has a massive community of talented and highly-experienced developers which produces plenty of free add-ons that can be integrated into applications. The free add-ons are beneficial for startups that aspire to launch a feature-rich app in the most compact time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In\nthe past few years, we have witnessed success stories of startups that launched\ntheir web project on Ruby on Rails. Since it has a vast community, the support\nyou get is rapid as a result of which you can develop solutions more quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ruby on Rails- Advantages and Drawbacks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like\nother technologies, Ruby on Rails also has its strengths and weaknesses, and without\nknowing this, you can&#8217;t make the right decision. When talking about Ruby on\nRails development, it is often a difference-maker when weighing the pros and\ncons. You will find the advantages and drawbacks of this extensive framework\nbelow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Advantages of Ruby on Rails framework<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No\ndeveloper can ignore the winning augments that this back-end framework\nexhibits. As soon as all of them are integrated, they cut down the development\ntime, making the process more effective. Some of the benefits that Ruby on Rails\nexhibits are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Extensive ecosystem<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When\ncompared to other frameworks, the ecosystem of Ruby on Rails makes it superior.\nRuby gems, a Ruby community\u2019s gem hosting service, grants entree to various\ngems, which can use the pattern of add-ons, libraries, or software snippets.\nThese gems are ready-made solutions for various difficulties that streamline\nthe development procedure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ruby on Rails MVC<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>MVC\nstands for Model-View-Controller, which is an integral component of the Ruby on\nRails framework. This approach distributes the app task in three subsystems,\nall of which is accountable for a set of actions:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Models manage data and\nmarket logic<\/li><li>Controllers handle the\nuser interface and application<\/li><li>Views control graphical\nuser interface objects and performance<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruby\non Rails MVC supports parallel development and lets app developers\u2019 speed up\nthe development process three times faster. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Consistency and clean code<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruby\non Rails developers can employ ready-to-use components of code which interprets\nthe implementation of several features; as a result, the app code is clean and\nhas high readability. As you have limited code to read and sort, all scheduled\nupdates are quick and seamless, making ROR development time and cost-efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DRY<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruby\non Rails is built on DRY where if there is a repetitive task, in Ruby on Rails\ndevelopment, you need not write the same code again and again. The framework\nrecognizes monotonous functions in a way that back-end developers can reuse\nthose codes an unlimited number of times.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>High scalability<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Scalability is another benefit to consider, which means an app developed on RoR can be scaled to process thousands of requests per second sent by various users. <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Shopify e-commerce (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/shopify-ecommerce-development\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shopify e-commerce<\/strong><\/a> platform is the best example of ROR performance, which handles up to 80k in a second.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Security\/ Time and cost-efficiency<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruby\non Rails takes no risks with security concerns and has some security-centric\nfeatures built-in that make apps guarded against SQL-injections and XSS\nattacks. Along with this, you will find plenty of gems that address security\nthreats. All of the features discussed earlier consolidate to make Ruby on\nRails time and cost-efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>RAD<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RAD\nstands for Rapid application development, which is another sphere Ruby on Rails\nis used for and streamlines the process of transformation accommodation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Self-documentation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruby\ncode is highly readable and self-documenting, making the development process\nfaster as no need to write separate documentation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Test environment<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruby\non Rails has default environments, i.e., production, development, and testing.\nThe development cycle is optimized, and you can test the product at every\nstage, resulting in fewer bugs and errors that you must be aware of and debug.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Convention over configuration<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Convention\nover configuration is the critical principle of Ruby on Rails development which\nlessens the time programmers spend on configuring files. This framework has a\nset of rules, making it simpler for aspiring Ruby on Rails developers to\ncommence using the framework. Using conventions, the codes become readable and\nbrief, allowing smooth navigation in Ruby on Rails web application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Drawbacks of Ruby on Rails framework<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite\nhaving lots of benefits, it also comes with a few drawbacks which are equally\nimportant when picking the right framework for your project.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Documentation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Documentation\nis challenging to seek out with Ruby on Rails framework. This problem is\never-present as only a few developers manage to document everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Runtime speed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead\nof being fast, Ruby and Rails is not quick as the other majority\nobject-oriented languages. When comparing the runtime speed of ROR with Node.JS\nand GoLang, Ruby on Rails lags, so runtime speed is the main argument against\nROR. But when comparing with Java framework Spring, ROR is in the win-win\nsituation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Boot speed<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Boot\nspeed is one of the frustrating aspects of Ruby on Rails. It may demand a\nnotable amount of time to originate the framework, depending on the number of\nfiles and gems utilized. A rails app preloader, spring solved this obstacle\nstill there are some efforts to be made to resolve the problem entirely.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Website hosting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not\nall website hosts support Ruby on Rails as this framework needs more resources\nthan PHP. Low-end hosting providers can&#8217;t afford the elemental processing\npowers. Still, you will find a number of website hosting providers that support\nROR apps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Last Words<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You must have gone through many companies that utilize Ruby on Rails in <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/web-application-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"web application development (opens in a new tab)\">web application development<\/a><\/strong>, rendering support, and shaping the way the framework is being developed. This technology does not serve any specific niche or restricted to some industries, but used to build various types of projects &amp; serve many industries. It offers a wide range of gems that streamline the development process. Ruby on Rails is evolving at a rapid pace, and the most awaited release Ruby version 3.0 is planned for the end of 2019 or commencement of 2020. With this release, we can expect to see Ruby on Rails becoming three times faster in the future as compared with the current version.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When developing a new application project, picking the appropriate technology stack is indispensable.
