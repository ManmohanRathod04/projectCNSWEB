This\nis what gave rise to technology and enhanced it from the roots of human\nexistence to the very end. From the invention of basic tools to the robots that\nwork for us, all are outcomes of this regular effort toward a simpler and\ncomfortable lifestyle. Whether we accept it or not but the existence of\ntechnology in our lives is irreplaceable and unmatchable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although technology has gifted us\nelectricity, modern machinery, internet, also we can see the nuclear weapon\nlead to world war, lots of distractions, cyber threats, etc. so deciding that\nwhether we are emerging toward boon or bane is very difficult. Let\u2019s check out\nthe major pros and cons, we got from technology in our life. To develop better\ntechnology in entire human welfare, check out the major terms that represent\nboth faces of technological inclusion in our lives:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Pros of Technology<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>More access to the information:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Internet has increased the\nreach of everyone to everything. It has offered us a vast range of\ninformational resources. When you experience surfing the internet, you get to\nknow different ideas, perspectives, and cultures as well. Realtime updates of\nnew stories and affairs, connecting with people, knowing about their lifestyles\nlike what they are up to this include profession, creativity, hobbies,\npictures, etc. collaboration through new platforms, chats, and feeds are\navailable on internet to know much more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should be thankful for the incredible gift of technology that is <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/iot-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Internet of Things (IoT) development (opens in a new tab)\">Internet of Things (IoT) development<\/a><\/strong>, you can access a set of services on it. Connecting with people worldwide has made us explore the world from one corner itself. Maximal data can be transferred through the internet from one device to another easily in very less time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>It helps you save time:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology saves your time, must\nthink about the older time when people had to write a letter to send a message,\nthe letter used to reach to the receiver in a minimum duration of 2-3 days. And\nit used to take the same time in reply. You can analyze the total time that is\nabout 1 week used to be consumed in the entire process of a message and its\nreply. Now various messaging apps are available where people chat and share\nnumerous messages sometimes in a minute even. This represents a huge difference\nin the ratio of time consumed and saved by technological ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you wanted to travel somewhere\nbefore, it used to take a lot of time in searching for a way that is quite\nunsafe and time taking also. Now numerous navigators like google maps are there\nfor you to show the entire route and get a better evaluation of the best-suited\nway for you to reach easily. Upgraded features of Google maps also let you know\nthe traffic on different routes now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Communication turned easy, fast and efficient:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Over a long time, <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"artificial intelligence (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/ai-chatbot-development\" target=\"_blank\">artificial intelligence<\/a><\/strong> has improved our way of communication and information transmission every decade. At the time of the industrial revolution, we developed great resources for better communication because of excessive requirement. As the need give rise to the invention. We invented the telegraph, which gave rise to the landline telephone, then we developed cell phones and now we are living in the smartphone era. The invention of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Optical_fiber\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"fiber optics (opens in a new tab)\">fiber optics<\/a><\/strong> enhanced the data transmission process well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Technology decreased the cost of many things:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major advantages of\ntechnology that has benefited lower class people most is the decrease in the\ncost of things and resources. Manufacturers all over the world can produce\ndifferent things in a high amount and in less time through the help of\ntechnology. This has raised the competition and competition led to a decrease\nin the cost of things. Now people can access everything easily as compared to\nbefore. Now with the assistance of technological ideas and smart machinery more\nand more businesses are heading to the market with versatility. This pool of\nidea has suppressed the cost of articles and services in the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Cons of Technology<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>It created a dependency:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>No one can deny that they cannot\nlive without electricity, smartphone, automobiles, the internet, as well. Less\nthan 5% of people will hardly agree to live without these things worldwide.\nMost of us have lost our mind power to a level due to technological assistance.\nPeople do not remember phone number due to mobile, all the documents and\ndetails are handled by your smartphone this is the reason you have nothing on\nyour mind related to such perspective. Calculators prevented mental\ncalculations; these all things represent that we are dependent on technology\nsomewhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Data storage brought security concerns:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>People use banking and UPI apps\nfor easy transfer of funds, but this also raises the security risk because you\nhave all the credit and debit details of your bank on the mobile app. A hacker\ncan clear your account in seconds if it gets the access credentials. Firstly,\nthe software is designed and then a security check, flaw penetration, testing,\nbug fixing, source code security, watermarking, etc. processes are performed\nfurther on it. Our almost information from details, photos, videos, audios,\ndocs, all are on the server in a risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>It is being addictive:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology gives you comfort, it\noften introduces new topics and slowly you become addicted to these things,\ntechnology is so amazing the user starts loving it. The major example of this\nis a smartphone, People are addicted to them, even we spend an average of\n3hr45min on screen and it becomes different when you change the field like, an IT\nperson spends more than 12 hours in front of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been several things\nthat turned user flinched when they asked to leave like video games,\nsmartphones, WiFi, and more. Moreover, fake news or twisted truths spread so\nfast with technical assistance and people trust it due to a deep trust in tech\nassisted things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Summing up<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed both advantages and\ndisadvantages of technology and its integration into our life. We cannot deny\nthat technology is very good to us but cannot ignore its negative impacts also.\nFor this, we have to solve this problem we need to consider everything\ncarefully ad use it in a limit as well. Perhaps the comfort of life lies with\ntechnology now.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>From the existence of life, human beings are dynamically using their brainpower to make their life easier.
