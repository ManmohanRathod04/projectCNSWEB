It influences every field of technology from the development of apps to software and tools or programming languages. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Go_(programming_language)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"GoLang (opens in a new tab)\">GoLang<\/a><\/strong> is one such language whose graph is going up in terms of growth and advancement that soon it will be regarded as one of the top 10 programming languages in the world. It has been seen that the language can be applied to real products, and its process 50 million logs with more than 200GB of data is processed each day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Features of\nGoLang:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Understanding\nGoLang is a piece of cake<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Google\nprogramming language is natural in learning because it is clean and\nstraightforward to read. No unique things are required to learn the basics of\nthe language. The programmers who are aware of the C-language syntax can read\nand understand the GoLanguage on their own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>GoLang is very\nfast<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The language is\nno doubt very fast and compiles to machine code quickly. The language does not\nperform any interpretation and has no virtual run time before compiling; hence,\nit is fast as compared to other languages. So its programs compile at a fast\npace and thus produces an executable file of hardly 11 to 12 MB.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Concurrent\nGoRoutine<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Concurrent\nprogramming is anytime tough. But with the GoLang, it is straightforward as\ncompared to various programming languages. The language creates a lightweight\nthread called goroutine and communicates using the same channel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Memory management<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The memory\nmanagement in Google\u2019s programming language is more straightforward than in\nother languages like C or C++ as it uses pointers and value types to store\ndynamically allocated objects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tools in GoLang<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The static\ntools in GoLang are very sturdy; for instance, gofmt is a tool that formats the\ncode according to GoLang\u2019s criterion. There are various other tools like a\ngofmt, golint vet, and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Testing in\nGoLang<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>GoLang\u2019s library comes with inbuilt testing support. There is no need to depend on the external texting medium. The things_test.go file is required to be written on followed by running the \u2018go test\u2019.\u00a0 This allows executing the test without taking much longer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Basic library<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>GoLang comes\nwith a central library with inbuilt functions to work with primitive types that\ncan work with a web server, cryptography, manage the raw bytes, and take care\nof I\/O.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Interfaces<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With several\nstructs to implement various interfaces in GoLang can make it simpler to handle\ndependencies in the code. Interfaces make it easier to write modular codes for\nthe test, and the availability of functions allows the language to write codes\nin a functional style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Static data\ntypes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>GoLang is a\nstatically typed language. It has primitive data types like byte, strong, and\nint. It also has structs, and like other strongly typed languages, GoLang can\ncatch hold of any number of bugs in the code. It also has easy to use lists and\nmaps built in the language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion:<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GoLang is a language that takes care of the machine time in a better way than languages like C or C++. The language is advancing at a pace like none other. Soon it will be in the top list of languages.
