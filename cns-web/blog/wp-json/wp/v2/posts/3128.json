This partnership means that one can now look for directions before choosing the taxi service directly from the Search app or mobile search browser.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\"><!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">This great feature was included in the latest version of Google Maps earlier this year, providing a tab with all the information for cab services in addition to the already existing public transport, driving, or walking options. With this further addition, a user can now ask Google for directions and book the cab service directly from Search only.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Google explains that when a will user type for particular information such as \u201cTaxi for airport\u201d or more expressly like \u201cOla to airport\u201d or \u201cUber to airport\u201d, this app\/ browser will direct the user to chose a service and will open the app to book the ride automatically, everything in just one touch. If the user would not have installed the app on his\/her device, Google Search will display a link to install the said application.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Sometimes, selecting the best possible traveling option can be quite a task, with the introduction of this service Google is trying to help users by simplifying the everyday transit. Generally, also a person looks for different cab service to decide the one suitable as per their convenience, especially price.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">So now with this, users will be able to book, explore and make fast comparisons about the best-estimated riding cost directly from Google Search on their device.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Ola stated earlier this month that users on its platform can hire a cab even when they don\u2019t have a data connection. In such situation, when a user is close to any ola cab network, the app itself will ask if they would like to use SMSs to hire the cab.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">Similarly, Uber also announced that a person can hire a cab on its platform from a mobile website without installing the app. Uber has also introduced a feature which allows people to book a cab for their friends and family.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">So, the next time you look for booking a cab with Ola or Uber, just Google it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more mobile technology and startup related news and updates, visit: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After Google joined hands with Ola and Uber, cab booking is now going to be even more trouble-free.
