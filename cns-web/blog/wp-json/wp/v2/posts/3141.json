Four years back i.e 2012, Sony introduced a software platform &#8211; PlayStation Mobile which let owners of \u201c<strong>PlayStation Affiliated<\/strong>\u201d phones such as the Sony Xperia series to download a range of classic and independently made PlayStation titles. However, the concept was unable to raise much interest in phone owners. Also, the PlayStation Vita handy console didn\u2019t sell in large numbers. PlayStation Mobile was discontinued in the summer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">However, now this year Nintendo made its own foray into the wide sector of Smartphones. After the successful launch of its Miitomo title earlier in March, the company invested in the development of sensational augmented reality titled <strong>Pokemon Go<\/strong>. This masterpiece has been downloaded over 500m times since its inception in July.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">In April, the company, which defied the Smartphone segment for numerous years, also disclosed that it is going to bring the much-loved console titles Fire Emblem and Animal Crossing to phones, plus the Evergreen Super Mario Run will be coming to iPhones and then to Android device \u2013 announced by legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto at Apple\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/iPhone-Development.html\"><strong>iPhone 7<\/strong><\/a> press conference in September.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">As the Nintendo has now taken the Smartphone sector seriously, so undoubtedly it is going to be a motivating factor for Sony.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">However, there are no reports as which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sony.co.in\/electronics\/playstation\"><strong>PlayStation<\/strong><\/a> titles will be launched to phones, or it can also be that developer might be working on some original titles or might be modifying its classic games. But it surely seems that titles such as Wipeout, Crash Bandicoot, Uncharted, and Gran Turismo will be in the picture.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify\">For more mobile technology and startup related news and updates, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It seems Pok\u00e9mon Go\u2019s immense success has got Sony all curious.
