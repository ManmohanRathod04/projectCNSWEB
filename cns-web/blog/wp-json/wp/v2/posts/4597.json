If so, you\u2019re going to need to make room in your SEO strategy for app optimization.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For apps, there are distinct ranking factors. Although they are similar to\u00a0ranking factors for a standard web page, there are differences that you need to know about.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s how you can optimize your app to get the best possible rank.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to\u00a0a recent Google report, 27 percent of users find apps through\u00a0a search engine. That\u2019s up from\u00a02 percent to 3 percent in 2014.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That trend will likely continue.\u00a0Why? Because Google is emphasizing app downloads\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/you-can-now-install-android-apps-directly-from-googles-search-results-240461\">from search results<\/a>\u00a0while brushing aside Google Play as a search engine.\u00a0Google has also become better at ranking apps, a trend we can expect to continue.<!--more--><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/think.storage.googleapis.com\/docs\/mobile-app-marketing-insights.pdf\">40 percent of people still find apps by searching in an app store<\/a>\u00a0as of now, it\u2019s still a great idea to plan for the future and optimize your app so people can find it with a search engine.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get in the App Pack<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although the word \u201capp\u201d can include web-based applications offered as a service, most people think of apps as mobile applications that people download and install.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a result, Google now includes an \u201capp pack\u201d at the top of the mobile search results. You can see it if you open up the browser on your mobile device and search for something like \u201cphoto editor.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The app pack will include between one and six apps. If more than six apps match the search query, Google will display an arrow at the bottom of the pack so that users can view the rest of the results.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Google also offers a decent amount of info about each app in the pack. In addition to displaying the app image and title, the app pack\u00a0also shows the app rating and price. Users who click on the app square are taken to the store where they can download and install the app.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another nice feature: apps displayed in the app pack are specific to the underlying platform. In other words, Android users will never see an app that\u2019s only available on iOS, even if that app matches the search term.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">There\u2019s a Downside, Though<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this point, you might think it would be great if your app showed up in the app pack. While there\u2019s an obvious benefit to appearing at the top of the mobile search results, there\u2019s also a downside.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bad news is that for every app that appears in the app pack, one\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/app-indexing-new-frontier-seo-app-packs-app-store-search-242319\">web ranking is pushed off the page<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For example, if your website is ranking at the very top of the organic mobile results for a keyword (or your brand name) and you optimize your app to appear in the app pack for the same keyword, this could push your organic listing down the page \u2014 possibly below the fold. That could have an impact on your search marketing efforts, especially if there was no app pack appearing for that search query before your app optimization efforts.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use the Right Keywords<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first thing to do to optimize your app for search engines is to take a page out of the SEO 101 play book: gather the right keywords.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In my experience with keyword research, I\u2019ve seen people who search for an app usually do so with a noun. They might search for something like \u201cphoto editor\u201d or \u201ctravel planner.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So start your optimization efforts by thinking more about what your app\u00a0<em>is\u00a0<\/em>than what it\u00a0<em>does<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cEdits photos\u201d is what your app\u00a0<em>does<\/em>. People\u00a0<em>won\u2019t<\/em>\u00a0search for that.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cPhoto editor\u201d is what your app\u00a0<em>is<\/em>. People\u00a0<em>will\u00a0<\/em>search for that.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Optimize the Title and Description<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can think of the title of your app much like the title tag of a web page. It\u2019s very important for SEO purposes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, Google evaluates app descriptions as text on a web page.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That\u2019s why you should optimize the app title and description just as you would optimize a web page title and its content. Use the keywords that you gathered from the first step and sprinkle them appropriately throughout the description. Put the most important keyword in the title.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep in mind, though, that you\u2019ll also want a branded title. For example, \u201cSnapHelper \u2014 A Photo Editor\u201d includes both the name of the app and an explanation of what it is.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, you\u2019ll face limitations on how many characters you can include in the app title (50 characters for app store, 30 for\u00a0Google Play). In that case, you\u2019ll have to get creative about what you\u2019ll include and how you\u2019ll include it.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">You Need Reviews<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s where app SEO parts company from more traditional SEO efforts: you need reviews.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For starters, your app might rank based on keywords included in reviews on the app page. It\u2019s often the case that keywords toward the top of the page are given more weight than keywords further down.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The star rating will also affect how your app ranks. You might notice that some apps with better ratings outrank other apps that have better keyword optimization. That\u2019s because Google pays attention to ratings.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Undoubtedly, the star rating will also affect the click-through rate. That will likely\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mobilecore.com\/9-ways-to-master-the-google-play-store-ranking\/#signup\">impact its rank as well<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use App-specific Keywords<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You\u2019re ranking for an app. Why not use the word \u201capp\u201d in your title and\/or description?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep in mind that people who search for an app in the app store probably won\u2019t use \u201capp\u201d in their search query. However, people who search for an app with a search engine are much more likely to use it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Optimize for the word \u201capp,\u201d and you\u2019ll likely stay ahead of your competition.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, use the name of the operating system in the app title and description. People using search engines to find an app will likely include their platform in the search query.<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wrapping it Up<\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Optimizing an app for the search engines is different from optimizing a web page. However, with the right know-how and a little bit of effort, you can boost your app to the top of the search results.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ref: <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/simple-tips-get-app-indexed-ranked-installed-273388\">http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/simple-tips-get-app-indexed-ranked-installed-273388<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Would you like to promote your App?\u00a0AppSquadz\u00a0a prominent mobile application development company provides some basic tips for helping your app to appear in Google&#8217;s &#8216;app pack&#8217; search results.
