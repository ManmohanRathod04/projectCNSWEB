This is one of the rare collaboration that is happening between two Silicon Valley Companies and whose operating system is powered 99% of the world\u2019s smartphone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a rare collaboration between the two\nSilicon Valley companies who have the operating system that powers about 99% of\nthe world\u2019s largest smartphones. These mobile\napplications will help to trace the patients if any of the COVID 19\npandemic and will help them to get treatment instantly so that others may not\nget affected. The usage of mobile applications can help to accerlate the\npotentially affected patients into testing or can be mad quarantine quickly so\nthat other may not get affected from the virus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This contact tracing app will play a significant role in managing the spread of coronavirus pandemic in this lockdown. So, those others may not get affected by this spread and will have a safer environment in the future. By suing this technology all the infected will come into the contact and can be sent for the treatment so that others may not get affected from the same. In this way, you can favor the decentralized system thus to trace the contacts and government in Asia and Europe where the spread of COVID is much more than any other country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does Contact Tracing App Will work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the pushing movement of centralized\napproaches, that have resulted in technical weakness and potentially let the\ngovernment understand with whom the people are associated is far much better.\nWith Apple and Google, people will get all the public functions that they might\nneed with the decentralized approaches and a privacy friendly app. The\ncentralized solutions are also proposed with other major countries such as\nGermany and Britain and they will also not work under the new technology until\nthe spread is not decreased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This application is very useful especially in the\nplace where the infected persons do not have any idea whom they had been close\nto for the extended duration. While it is not mandatory that people have to use\nthis mobile application, but if anyone is using then they have to open or turn\non their Bluetooth settings in their mobile devices so that tracing can be done\nperfectly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The need to enable the push notification is also\nrequired if you are using this mobile application and your location permission\nin the app is also mandatory which is available on the Google Play Store or Apple Play Store. Currently, this has not\nbeen recorded how many people are using this mobile application.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this mobile application, the official contact\ntracers can provide the code which users can match up to with the verification\nprocess or the code on their app. Once the verification code is authenticated,\nthen the users will get a PIN that will allow the data to be submitted. The\ntraces will never ask from the user for any personal financial details or the\nrequest to transfer any amount over their mobile devices, so be aware of the\nfraudulent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When users are using this mobile application,\nthen they will also be asked for sharing their data logs. If the user does not\nshare their data logs, then they will be prosecuted under the Infectious\nDiseases Act and they will have certain legal actions to be taken.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Is the Mobile Application Substitute for testing?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple and Google have panned to release this software\nfor mobile applications in the mid of May to contact tracing apps which they\nand the public health authorities will approve and also said that the new tool\nwill enable them to drop potentially unreliable work all around. The apps will\nhelp to focus on developing a simple interface so that everyone or the other\nperson can use this mobile application. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interface of this mobile application is kept very simple and user friendly so that the users and the workers of <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/healthcare-fitness-mobile-app-development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">healthcare industry<\/a><\/strong> can use it. With Apple and Google handling Bluetooth and privacy issues, this app will play a significant role in controlling the spread of this virus and thus will help to prevent and cure people much faster.&nbsp; However, this mobile application is being launched in the mid of the month, and therefore users need not have to separate app to log nearby phones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has also been stated that this is not a\nsubstitute for testing but the users must be aware of that it produces the\nactionable results so that people can act responsibly and self-isolate\nthemselves to avoid the spread and in contact of this virus and thus decrease\nthe anxiety in the community about the spread as a whole.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, this <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\">mobile app development<\/a><\/strong> of developing contact tracing app will help not only the users but also the healthcare department to prevent the spread of this virus and make people free and aware of the anxiety that they are facing in the community. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple and Google have recently announced that there is a huge collaboration between both of them to create a contact tracing app. The main aim of creating this app is<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":16,"featured_media":7842,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_bbp_topic_count":0,"_bbp_reply_count":0,"_bbp_total_topic_count":0,"_bbp_total_reply_count":0,"_bbp_voice_count":0,"_bbp_anonymous_reply_count":0,"_bbp_topic_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_reply_count_hidden":0,"_bbp_forum_subforum_count":0},"categories":[228],"tags":[2498,2499,2408,2495,2493,2063],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v16.1.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Apple and Google have accerlated a contact tracing mobile application to detect the coronavirus pandemic spread among people in all countries.\" \/>\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/apple-google-accerlates-coronavirus-contact-tracing-apps\/\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:locale\" content=\"en_US\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" \/>\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Apple &amp;
