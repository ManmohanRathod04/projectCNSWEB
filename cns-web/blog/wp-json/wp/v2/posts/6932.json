Since then, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"mobile application development (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>mobile application development<\/strong><\/a> companies have been engaged in developing wearable mobile apps. In today\u2019s world, the popularity of Wearables has shifted to the healthcare industry also. There emerged the need for the Wearables ultimately as people are a bit busy and can&#8217;t take care of their well-being in a conventional way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Emergence of Wearables- need for Wearable Technology<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These devices are the perfect solution which is worn continuously on the body that monitors several health parameters, and suitably transmit information about the health conditions to the users and doctors. In the last four years, the use of wearable technology has tripled because of the increasing demand of consumers More than 80% of users are willing to use fitness Wearables- a study from Business Insider Intelligence stated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the\ninfluence of medical Wearables, the traditional patient-doctor model is\nundergoing significant changes. Sensors in wearable devices automate processes,\nspeed up diagnosis procedure, and treatment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past\ndecade, Wearables like fitness bands, Smartwatches, or Google glass are adopted\nextensively by consumers. As per the current research, by 2027, the wearable\ntechnology market is set to reach $150 Billion. These wearable devices are\nconnected to the Internet of Things, (which is again an impactful technology)\nis disrupting medical practice at a vigorous pace forming a modern era of the\nhealthcare industry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is Wearable Health Technology?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearable\ntechnology is about the electronic devices that users wear for accumulating\ndiverse natures of data of their health conditions that can be used for\nmultiple purposes. These kinds of devices are incredibly user-friendly and\nunobstructed. Healthcare Industry uses these Wearables extensively; especially\nHospitals most often use Wearables. Healthcare sector uses Wearables because doctors\nand nurses have to keep constant updations of patient&#8217;s vitals and conditions\nthat too in very less time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Some factors that propel the popularity of medical Wearables are:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Grant more\ninnocuous working conditions and predict employee injuries and fatal accidents\ndue to fatigue or other factors<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A rise in\nthe number of smartphones in the present scenario<\/li><li>Integration\nof sensors into user devices<\/li><li>A more\nconvenient approach to take medical support<\/li><li>More\nfreedom<\/li><li>Elevated\nhealth and fitness awareness<\/li><li>Involvement\nof giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft<\/li><li>Promote\ncustomer service<\/li><li>Raise\nproductivity<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Where there\nare so many advantages of wearable devices, then it is obvious it also has some\nrestrictions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Here are the factors that prevent the implementation of Wearables.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Huge Cost\nincurred<\/li><li>Private\ndata security concerns<\/li><li>Absence of\ncommon standards<\/li><li>Interoperability\nissues may arise<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussing\nfurther, let us move onto way by Wearables are transfiguring healthcare\nindustry and what devices are out in the market and how they are benefitting\nthe users and the doctors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How wearable devices are driving the healthcare sector:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wearable Fitness Trackers<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearable <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Fitness Trackers (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Activity_tracker\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fitness Trackers<\/strong><\/a>, one of the simplest and innovative forms of wearable health technology, are wristbands that have in build sensors in it, which keeps track of a user&#8217;s physical activity accompanying the heart rate. This wearable device provides recommendations by syncing to several smartphone apps which makes it useful from the perspective of the users.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Smart Health Watches<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Presently, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Smartwatches (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/iwatch-app-development\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Smartwatches<\/strong><\/a> have transformed into clinically viable healthcare tool. In 2017, Apple launched the Apple heart study app that observes the heartbeat of the users and alerts those who were experiencing atrial fibrillation. With the Smartwatch, the user may also perform tasks of the routine like reading notifications, send simple messages, and make phone calls. Also, it suggests some of the health tracking benefits of fitness trackers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wearable ECG monitors<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearable\nECG monitors can measure electrocardiograms and send the reading to the user&#8217;s\ndoctor, as well as detects atrial fibrillation. Along with this, Wearable ECG\nMonitors can also track the pace, distance, and elevation. Also, automatic\ntracking for walking, running, swimming, and biking can also be done with these\nmonitors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wearable Blood Pressure Monitors<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This year,\nOmron Healthcare launched the first wearable blood pressure monitor named\nHeartGuide. It is an oscillometric blood pressure monitor which can measure\nblood pressure along with daily activities such as steps taken, distance\nwalked, and calories consumed. Wearable Blood Pressure Monitors can store,\ntrack, and share data with the doctors, which can help provide the best\ntreatment to the patients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Biosensors&nbsp;<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Biosensors\nare entirely different from wrist trackers and Smartwatches. A biosensor is a\nself-adhesive application which enables patients to move around while\naccumulating data on their movement, heart rate, respiratory rate, progress, and\ntemperature. This wearable again has got great potential and ability to improve\npatient&#8217;s outcomes and perhaps lessen staff workload.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>[<\/strong>Also Read:<strong> <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Wearable Devices App Development \u2013 The Next Big Thing in IT Industry (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/wearable-devices-app-development\/\" target=\"_blank\">Wearable Devices App Development \u2013 The Next Big Thing in IT Industry<\/a>]<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion&nbsp; <\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wearable technology has got enormous potential, and this fact is no more a mystery. With lots of dependence of each industry on technology, daily new inventions and discoveries take place to make the functioning of these industries comfortably. The potential that Wearables possess is not hidden in today&#8217;s world. People are likely to adopt wearable devices because Wearables have become a trend. Wearable technologies are making a splash in the market due to increased demand.
