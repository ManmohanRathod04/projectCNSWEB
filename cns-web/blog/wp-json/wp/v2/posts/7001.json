However, the iPhone users have been using the beta software since it was available in June at WWDC. This beta version was accessible\u00a0to induce\u00a0a transparent\u00a0image of how the new OS updates will operate. The latest version is damn pretty and has now come up with many improvements. Earlier this month, Apple introduced iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, and iPhone 11 Pro Max, which are Apple&#8217;s new top-of-the-line smartphones. Sounds dramatic, but with iOS 13, Apple once again takes on <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/google-launched-android-10-fascinating-features\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Google's Android 10 (opens in a new tab)\">Google&#8217;s Android 10<\/a><\/strong> in a constant battle of being the most dominant, private, and adaptable OS. iOS 13 is packed with dozens of killer features, and here we will be discussing all the significant features of iOS 13.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Power-packed features of iOS 13, Apple&#8217;s next-generation iOS operating system<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dark mode<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new system-wide Dark Mode is the noticeable and heavily\nmarketed feature of iOS 13. Buttons and other elements that typically appeared\nwhite or bright in the previous versions will be now black or dark. Some people\nlove dark modes found on different OS like MacOS and Android. People think the\ndark mode is easier on the eyes and also claim that it saves battery life.\nAfter installing iOS 13 on your iPhones, you can toggle the dark mode on or off\nfrom Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Appearance &gt; Dark.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sign in with Apple<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people are familiar with universal logins and all thanks\nto Facebook and Google for allowing log-in to third party and websites without\ncreating separate accounts on those sites. Instead of logging in to those\nsites, sign in with Facebook or Google. Like Facebook and Google login options,\nApple&#8217;s universal login allows creating accounts for and log in to apps and\nwebsites quickly. The difference is Apple gives minimum information about you\nto those apps and sites, and also, Apple won&#8217;t track any of your activities on\nthe apps or websites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple maps is an actual google maps competitor now<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Maps have been subpar to Google&#8217;s for years but with\nthe new launch that no longer holds true for the most part. Apple has nailed it\nthis time by introducing its own Street View-like feature called \u201cLook Around,\u201d\nand it&#8217;s stunning that surpasses the Google Maps.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Siri finds a new voice<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Siri doesn&#8217;t have the most exceptional track record of being a standout feature in iOS, but in iOS 13, Apple has made major strides. Google\u2019s Assistant and Amazon\u2019s Alexa perform better, but the impressive improvement in <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Siri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Apple's Siri (opens in a new tab)\">Apple&#8217;s Siri<\/a> <\/strong>is its new voice. With this new launch, Siri&#8217;s voice will be 100% computer-generated, unlike the previous versions where Apple was using prerecorded audio clips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reminders are much more powerful<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In iOS 13, the built-in app gets a comprehensive revamp with\nan all-new interface. The most solid feature of the new reminders app is a\nquick toolbar that makes it simple to add dates, time, locations, flags, and\nattachments to your reminders. The Reminders app has now emerged as a powerful\nto-do and productivity tool with the new launch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Face Id gets a speed boost<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Face ID feature is Apple&#8217;s biometric security system included\nin iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPhone XS series, iPhone 11, and iPhone 11 Pro series.\nThis feature allows you to unlock your phone, verify purchase and sign into the\napps &amp; sites by showing your face, making iPhone feel like magic. It is\nsafe and secure, and in iOS 13, this feature has got even better than before,\nand this technology will unlock the iPhone 30% faster. Face ID&#8217;s speed boost is\nsoftware-based, so any iPhone with Face ID will unlock faster if you install\niOS 13.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>AirPods sharing is great for couples<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple&#8217;s hottest accessory ever made is its AirPods wireless earbuds iOS 13 has come up with expanded capabilities. In the iOS 13 version, two users can connect AirPods with a single iPhone. It will be a terrific feature that is going to be undoubtedly popular with couples. Until iOS 13.1 is released on September 30, the AirPods sharing feature of iOS 13 is not officially available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5>[ Also Read: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Apple\u2019s Next-gen iOS Operating System: iOS 13 Preview Expected in June (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/blog\/apple-ios-operating-system-ios-13-preview\/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple\u2019s Next-gen iOS Operating System: iOS 13 Preview Expected in June<\/a> ]<\/h5>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion:<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This time Apple gave a big surprise by allowing the biggest new additions to this new iOS version. Most of the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsquadz.com\/iPhone-Development\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"iPhone app development company (opens in a new tab)\">iPhone app development company<\/a><\/strong> will look forward to see what additions they can do for the iPhone users, which outstand their app on new iOS 13.
